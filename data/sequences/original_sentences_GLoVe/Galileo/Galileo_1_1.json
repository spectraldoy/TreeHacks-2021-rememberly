{"source_units": ["Galileo Galilei was an Italian astronomer, physicist, and philosopher,\nwho played a significant role in the scientific revolution of the 17th century.", "He pioneered the use of quantitative methods, conducting carefully designed experiments and performing mathematical analysis on the results.", "Before Galileo, logic had been viewed as the basic intellectual tool of science in Europe for over a millennium.", "Although logic dominated scientific methods, there was a strong tradition of using mathematics in music theory.", "For example, in the Pythagorean tradition of music, whole-number mathematical relationships define harmonious scales.", "As a young man, Galileo learned the power of mathematical analysis from his father,\nVincenzo Galilei, a musician and music theorist, who had discovered the non-linear relation between the tension and the pitch of a stretched string through experimental methods.", "Galileo developed the use of mathematics in science, but his lifelong passion was for astronomy, a fascination that began early in his life.", "While studying at the University of Pisa, Galileo succeeded in constructing a telescope capable of greater magnification than anything built before it.", "He was one of the first people to use a telescope to observe the night sky.", "Although he was forced to cease his studies at the University of Pisa for financial reasons,\nhe was soon offered a faculty position at the University of Padua.", "Galileo continued to make many significant discoveries.", "For example, he detected the moons of Jupiter, an observation that upset the notion that all celestial bodies must revolve around the Earth.", "During one of his frequent trips away from his new faculty position at Padua, Galileo met a young woman named Marina di Andrea Gamba,\nwith whom he had three illegitimate children: Virginia, Livia, and Vincenzio.", "None of the three baptismal records name Galileo as the father.", "When Galileo left Padua for good to take up his position at the Medici court in Florence, in 1610,\nhe sent both girls to the convent of San Matteo in Arcetri.", "Interestingly, Galileo managed to have Vincenzio legitimated by the Grand Duke of Tuscany.", "The reason for this unequal treatment is probably that Galileo would not be able to provide sufficiently large doweries for his daughters to allow them to make marriages appropriate to his stature at the Medici court.", "Marina Gamba later married another man, Giovanni Bartoluzzi, but records indicate that Galileo kept cordial relations with both of them.", "Later in his career, Galileo was persecuted for his bold support of heliocentrism, the view that the planets revolve around the Sun.", "His controversial book, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, was initially published in 1632 with permission from Pope Urban VIII, an admirer of Galileo.", "Pope Urban VIII asked that his own views be included in Galileo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s book as a condition for allowing it to be published,\nso Galileo created the character \"Simplicius\" to express the Pope\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thoughts.", "\"Simplicius\" defended the geocentric view and generally came across as a fool.", "By portraying \"Simplicius\" in this manner, Galileo angered one of his biggest and most powerful supporters.", "As a result, Galileo was convicted of heresy in 1633, his ideas were banned, and he spent the remainder of his life under house arrest until his death in 1642."], "response_units": ["Gallileo was an astromer, physicist, and philospher in the 17th century.", "There wasn't much about logic in science at the time.", "Gallileo was really good at math.", "His father was a musician and shared that with his son.", "Gallileo's true passion was with astronomy.", "He went to University of Pisa were he studied astronomy and built a telescope.", "He then went to go on to teach at University of Purdua.", "He married Mariana Gamba and had 3 illegitimate children with her.", "He was able to get one Duke of Tuscany to legitimize his daughter Vincenza.", "Mariana remarried and Gallileo kept cordial relations with them.", "Gallileo was criticized for his astro something theory, which says that the sun orbits the earth.", "He wrote a book called Discovery something (I don't remember) explaining this.", "His one friend, heger, supported him and wanted to be a part of the book so he named the character Simplicius but that character was considered foolish.", "His friend heger was insulted and Gallileo lost a very supportive
