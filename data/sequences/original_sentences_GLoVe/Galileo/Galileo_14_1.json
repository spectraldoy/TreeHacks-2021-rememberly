{"source_units": ["Galileo Galilei was an Italian astronomer, physicist, and philosopher,\nwho played a significant role in the scientific revolution of the 17th century.", "He pioneered the use of quantitative methods, conducting carefully designed experiments and performing mathematical analysis on the results.", "Before Galileo, logic had been viewed as the basic intellectual tool of science in Europe for over a millennium.", "Although logic dominated scientific methods, there was a strong tradition of using mathematics in music theory.", "For example, in the Pythagorean tradition of music, whole-number mathematical relationships define harmonious scales.", "As a young man, Galileo learned the power of mathematical analysis from his father,\nVincenzo Galilei, a musician and music theorist, who had discovered the non-linear relation between the tension and the pitch of a stretched string through experimental methods.", "Galileo developed the use of mathematics in science, but his lifelong passion was for astronomy, a fascination that began early in his life.", "While studying at the University of Pisa, Galileo succeeded in constructing a telescope capable of greater magnification than anything built before it.", "He was one of the first people to use a telescope to observe the night sky.", "Although he was forced to cease his studies at the University of Pisa for financial reasons,\nhe was soon offered a faculty position at the University of Padua.", "Galileo continued to make many significant discoveries.", "For example, he detected the moons of Jupiter, an observation that upset the notion that all celestial bodies must revolve around the Earth.", "During one of his frequent trips away from his new faculty position at Padua, Galileo met a young woman named Marina di Andrea Gamba,\nwith whom he had three illegitimate children: Virginia, Livia, and Vincenzio.", "None of the three baptismal records name Galileo as the father.", "When Galileo left Padua for good to take up his position at the Medici court in Florence, in 1610,\nhe sent both girls to the convent of San Matteo in Arcetri.", "Interestingly, Galileo managed to have Vincenzio legitimated by the Grand Duke of Tuscany.", "The reason for this unequal treatment is probably that Galileo would not be able to provide sufficiently large doweries for his daughters to allow them to make marriages appropriate to his stature at the Medici court.", "Marina Gamba later married another man, Giovanni Bartoluzzi, but records indicate that Galileo kept cordial relations with both of them.", "Later in his career, Galileo was persecuted for his bold support of heliocentrism, the view that the planets revolve around the Sun.", "His controversial book, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, was initially published in 1632 with permission from Pope Urban VIII, an admirer of Galileo.", "Pope Urban VIII asked that his own views be included in Galileo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s book as a condition for allowing it to be published,\nso Galileo created the character \"Simplicius\" to express the Pope\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thoughts.", "\"Simplicius\" defended the geocentric view and generally came across as a fool.", "By portraying \"Simplicius\" in this manner, Galileo angered one of his biggest and most powerful supporters.", "As a result, Galileo was convicted of heresy in 1633, his ideas were banned, and he spent the remainder of his life under house arrest until his death in 1642."], "response_units": ["Galileo was one of the first scientists to use mathmatics over logic, which was the prevailing theory of thought at the time.", "Mathmatics was rare but was used in music theory, where something was in whole number ratios.", "Galileo's father was a musician and music theorist who did experiments on strings to determine that something with pitch could be in fractional ratios.", "Galileo learned math from his dad and went on to study at the university of pauda.", "There he was able to develop the first telescope that saw the entire night sky, but he had to drop out for financial reasons.", "He later took up a post as a professer at a different university, where he made other strides, like discovering one of jupiter's moons.", "While he was there he met a woman whom he fathered 3 illegitimate children with.", "Two of the children were sent off somewhere, while the third was legitimized.", "This unequal treatment happened because Galileo didn't have enough money for the dowerys to legitimize them all according to his standing in the Medici court.", "The mother of his children went on to marry someone else, but the three of them were cordial.", "Galileo went on to advocate for heliocentrism and publish a book on the topic.", "The pope at the time allowed this despite the view being contrary to the church's, but made Galileo mention the pope's views in the book.", "Galileo did this by expressing the pope's views through the character simplicus.", "Simplicus was portrayed as a fool in the book, so Galileo was put on house arrest in 1633 until his death in 1647 for heresay."], "correspondences": [2, 3, 5, 9, 8, 9, 12, 23,
