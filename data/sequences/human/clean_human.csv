15910	23	295	study	2	190	who played a significant role in the scientific revolution of the 17th century.	[70, 149]	human	Galileo	1
15911	23	295	study	3	191	He pioneered the use of quantitative methods, conducting carefully designed experiments and performing mathematical analysis on the results.	[149, 289]	human	Galileo	1
15912	23	295	study	4	192	Before Galileo, logic had been viewed as the basic intellectual tool of science in Europe for over a millennium.	[289, 401]	human	Galileo	1
15913	23	295	study	5	193	Although logic dominated scientific methods, there was a strong tradition of using mathematics in music theory.	[401, 512]	human	Galileo	1
15914	23	295	study	6	194	For example, in the Pythagorean tradition of music, whole-number mathematical relationships define harmonious scales.	[512, 629]	human	Galileo	1
15915	23	295	study	7	195	As a young man, Galileo learned the power of mathematical analysis from his father,	[629, 712]	human	Galileo	1
15916	23	295	study	8	196	Vincenzo Galilei, a musician and music theorist, who had discovered the non-linear relation between the tension and the pitch of a stretched string through experimental methods.	[712, 889]	human	Galileo	1
15917	23	295	study	9	197	Galileo developed the use of mathematics in science, but his lifelong passion was for astronomy, a fascination that began early in his life.	[889, 1029]	human	Galileo	1
15918	23	295	study	10	198	While studying at the University of Pisa, Galileo succeeded in constructing a telescope capable of greater magnification than anything built before it.	[1029, 1180]	human	Galileo	1
15919	23	295	study	11	199	He was one of the first people to use a telescope to observe the night sky.	[1180, 1255]	human	Galileo	1
15920	23	295	study	12	200	Although he was forced to cease his studies at the University of Pisa for financial reasons,	[1255, 1347]	human	Galileo	1
15921	23	295	study	13	201	he was soon offered a faculty position at the University of Padua.	[1347, 1413]	human	Galileo	1
15922	23	295	study	14	202	Galileo continued to make many significant discoveries.	[1413, 1468]	human	Galileo	1
15923	23	295	study	15	203	For example, he detected the moons of Jupiter, an observation that upset the notion that all celestial bodies must revolve around the Earth.	[1468, 1608]	human	Galileo	1
15924	23	295	study	16	204	During one of his frequent trips away from his new faculty position at Padua, Galileo met a young woman named Marina di Andrea Gamba,	[1608, 1741]	human	Galileo	1
15925	23	295	study	17	205	with whom he had three illegitimate children: Virginia, Livia, and Vincenzio.	[1741, 1818]	human	Galileo	1
15926	23	295	study	18	206	None of the three baptismal records name Galileo as the father.	[1818, 1881]	human	Galileo	1
15927	23	295	study	19	207	When Galileo left Padua for good to take up his position at the Medici court in Florence, in 1610,	[1881, 1979]	human	Galileo	1
15928	23	295	study	20	208	he sent both girls to the convent of San Matteo in Arcetri.	[1979, 2038]	human	Galileo	1
15929	23	295	study	21	209	Interestingly, Galileo managed to have Vincenzio legitimated by the Grand Duke of Tuscany.	[2038, 2128]	human	Galileo	1
15930	23	295	study	22	210	The reason for this unequal treatment is probably that Galileo would not be able to provide sufficiently large doweries for his daughters to allow them to make marriages appropriate to his stature at the Medici court.	[2128, 2345]	human	Galileo	1
15931	23	295	study	23	211	Marina Gamba later married another man, Giovanni Bartoluzzi, but records indicate that Galileo kept cordial relations with both of them.	[2345, 2481]	human	Galileo	1
15932	23	295	study	24	212	Later in his career, Galileo was persecuted for his bold support of heliocentrism, the view that the planets revolve around the Sun.	[2481, 2613]	human	Galileo	1
15933	23	295	study	25	213	His controversial book, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, was initially published in 1632 with permission from Pope Urban VIII, an admirer of Galileo.	[2613, 2778]	human	Galileo	1
15934	23	295	study	26	214	Pope Urban VIII asked that his own views be included in Galileoâ€™s book as a condition for allowing it to be published,	[2778, 2898]	human	Galileo	1
15935	23	295	study	27	215	"so Galileo created the character ""Simplicius"" to express the Popeâ€™s thoughts."	[2898, 2977]	human	Galileo	1
15936	23	295	study	28	216	"""Simplicius"" defended the geocentric view and generally came across as a fool."	[2977, 3055]	human	Galileo	1

15938	23	295	study	30	218	As a result, Galileo was convicted of heresy in 1633, his ideas were banned, and he spent the remainder of his life under house arrest until his death in 1642.	[3162, 3321]	human	Galileo	1
