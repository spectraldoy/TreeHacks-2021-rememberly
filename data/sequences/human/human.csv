18854	23	295	study	3	2908	He pioneered the use of quantitative methods, conducting carefully designed experiments and performing mathematical analysis on the results.	[149, 289]	human	Galileo	1
18855	23	295	study	4	2909	Before Galileo, logic had been viewed as the basic intellectual tool of science in Europe for over a millennium.	[289, 401]	human	Galileo	1
18856	23	295	study	5	2910	Although logic dominated scientific methods, there was a strong tradition of using mathematics in music theory.	[401, 512]	human	Galileo	1
18857	23	295	study	6	2911	For example, in the Pythagorean tradition of music, whole-number mathematical relationships define harmonious scales.	[512, 629]	human	Galileo	1
18858	23	295	study	7	2912	As a young man, Galileo learned the power of mathematical analysis from his father,	[629, 712]	human	Galileo	1
18859	23	295	study	8	2913	Vincenzo Galilei, a musician and music theorist, who had discovered the non-linear relation between the tension and the pitch of a stretched string through experimental methods.	[712, 889]	human	Galileo	1
18860	23	295	study	9	2914	Galileo developed the use of mathematics in science, but his lifelong passion was for astronomy, a fascination that began early in his life.	[889, 1029]	human	Galileo	1

18862	23	295	study	11	2916	He was one of the first people to use a telescope to observe the night sky.	[1180, 1255]	human	Galileo	1
18863	23	295	study	12	2917	Although he was forced to cease his studies at the University of Pisa for financial reasons,	[1255, 1347]	human	Galileo	1
18864	23	295	study	13	2918	he was soon offered a faculty position at the University of Padua.	[1347, 1413]	human	Galileo	1
18865	23	295	study	14	2919	Galileo continued to make many significant discoveries.	[1413, 1468]	human	Galileo	1
18866	23	295	study	15	2920	For example, he detected the moons of Jupiter, an observation that upset the notion that all celestial bodies must revolve around the Earth.	[1468, 1608]	human	Galileo	1
18867	23	295	study	16	2921	During one of his frequent trips away from his new faculty position at Padua, Galileo met a young woman named Marina di Andrea Gamba,	[1608, 1741]	human	Galileo	1
18868	23	295	study	17	2922	with whom he had three illegitimate children: Virginia, Livia, and Vincenzio.	[1741, 1818]	human	Galileo	1
18869	23	295	study	18	2923	None of the three baptismal records name Galileo as the father.	[1818, 1881]	human	Galileo	1

18871	23	295	study	20	2925	he sent both girls to the convent of San Matteo in Arcetri.	[1979, 2038]	human	Galileo	1
18872	23	295	study	21	2926	Interestingly, Galileo managed to have Vincenzio legitimated by the Grand Duke of Tuscany.	[2038, 2128]	human	Galileo	1
18873	23	295	study	22	2927	The reason for this unequal treatment is probably that Galileo would not be able to provide sufficiently large doweries for his daughters to allow them to make marriages appropriate to his stature at the Medici court.	[2128, 2345]	human	Galileo	1
18874	23	295	study	23	2928	Marina Gamba later married another man, Giovanni Bartoluzzi, but records indicate that Galileo kept cordial relations with both of them.	[2345, 2481]	human	Galileo	1
18875	23	295	study	24	2929	Later in his career, Galileo was persecuted for his bold support of heliocentrism, the view that the planets revolve around the Sun.	[2481, 2613]	human	Galileo	1
18876	23	295	study	25	2930	His controversial book, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, was initially published in 1632 with permission from Pope Urban VIII, an admirer of Galileo.	[2613, 2778]	human	Galileo	1
