You can say all you want about the thick fogs in England. They don't have anything on the fog that comes in over Fundy, Maine. I'm telling you that it gets so thick up here that you could drive a nail through the fog that comes over Maine.



I have a friend who owns a fishing boat, and he saves all his chores for those foggy days. Well, one day it was so foggy that he couldn't go fishing so he decided to shingle his house. He was up shingling all day. 



When he came in for dinner, he told his wife, "my goodness we have such a long house! It took me all day to shingle!" She thought about it, and knew that their house was actually rather small. She went out to look at what he had done, and he kept on shingling right past the house!
