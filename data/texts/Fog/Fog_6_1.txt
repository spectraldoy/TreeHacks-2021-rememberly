You may say that England has think fog, but it does not compare to fog in Fundy in Maine. Some say the fog is so think that if you walk out to it with a nail and hammer it, you can hang your hat on in. 

Mr. () owns a fishing company in Maine, but when the fog is so bad, he can't take the boat out. On days like this, he would leave his house work for days like this. One day the fog came in heavy at night and he couldn't go out, he decided to fix the shingles on the house. So after breakfast he went to the roof to fix the shingles. After an entire day he come back in for dinner and tells his wife "we she go have a long roof". He wife knew they had a small house, she  went outside to look and the roof and sure enough, he added shingles to the fog.
