You can say what you want about the thick fogs of England but they compare nothing to the thick fogs that come over the Bay of Fundy in Maine. Many people can't go to work. The fog here becomes so thick you can drive a nail into it and hang up your hat. It's the honest truth. 



The speaker's neighbor, Dave, in Maine works on a fishing boat. When the fog is bad, Dave is unable to go to work so he stays home and does chores. One foggy day, Dave decides his house's roof needs shingling so he heads up to the roof to get the job done. Dave doesn't finish shingling or return into the house until dinner time. At this point,  he tells his wife "We have a mighty long roof. It took me the entire day to shingle it". His wife, Sarah, knew they had a small home and was skeptical. She went outside to investigate and to her surprise her husband had shingled the entire roof and straight out over the fog!
