You can say what you want to about the fog in England but it doesn't stand up to the fog in Maine. The fog over the Fundy Bay in Maine is so thick you could drive a nail into it. My friend Dave is a fisher and he saves his chores for foggy days. One day a thick fog came in overnight and so he decided to re-shingle the house. He took all day to re-shingle. He called out, "Sarah, I don't remember our house being this long." Sarah came outside and found that he had shingled the entire roof and out past it right on top of the fog.
