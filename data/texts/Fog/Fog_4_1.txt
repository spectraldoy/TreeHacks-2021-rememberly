You can say what you want about the thick fogs in England. But I'm telling you now, nothing can beat the fogs we have here in Maine. People joke that our fog is so thick, you could hang a nail and your hat on it.



One day, a man tried to go fishing. As the fog rolled in, he realized he couldn't go fishing, and he decided to shingle the roof instead. He was up on the roof for a long time. When he came in for dinner after finishing, he told his wife, "Wow. We sure have a long house! It took me all day to shingle!"



Knowing that they had a short house, his wife thought something was up. Sure enough, he had shingled past the roof onto the fog!
