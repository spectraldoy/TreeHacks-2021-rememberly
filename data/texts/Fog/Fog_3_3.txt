There's nothing like a Maine fog. You can say what you want about those Fogs over in England- but I'm telling you, sure as I'm standing here, that they don't hold a candle to the fog right her in Manapeake Bay. You can drive a nail into it and hang your hat up on it!

My neighbor, Jim, works on a fishing boat, and when the fog rolls in he can't even head out! One day, the fog came rolling in overnight, and Jim decided to stay in. He usually saved his chores for a fog day, and today he decided he was going to fix the roof. He went out right after breakfast, and didn't come back in until right before dinner. "I tell you, Sarah, we sure do have a long house," he said to his wife. Sarah knew full well that their house was small, and went outside to look at the roof. It turns out Jim had kept shingling right out into the fog!
