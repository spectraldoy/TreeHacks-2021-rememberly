You can say all you want about the thick fogs of England, but they can't hold a candle to the thick fogs of Fundy Bay in Maine. Allegedly, you could hammer a nail into these foggy conditions and hang your hat on it!



David is a Maine fisherman and cannot complete his job in these foggy conditions. Therefore, he saves other household chores to complete on such days. One day David saw the dense fog rolling in and knew that he could not go fishing that morning. Therefore, he decided to shingle his roof instead, and started right after breakfast and worked well into the evening.



At supper that night he remarked to his wife that they have "such a long roof" given that it took him all day to shingle their roof. However, Sarah recognized that they actually have a small house, and  thus went outdoors to confirm that David had indeed shingled well past the roof and into the fog beyond their residence!
