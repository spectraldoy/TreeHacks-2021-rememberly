You can say all you want about the thick fogs in England, but I'm telling you they don't even hold a candle to the fogs we have here in Maine. The fog is so thick that you can put a nail through it and hang your hat on it. My fried Dave knows this and normally will save all of his chores for a day that is foggy. One day, the fog came in really thick and he decided to shingle his roof. He was up there all day laying shingles and came in at dinner time. He said to his wife "boy we really have a lot of shingles for such a small house." His  wife, knowing that they had a small house went outside to take a look. Sure enough Dave had shingled right past the roof and on top of the fog.
