You can say all you want about England fogs being thick, but I tell you they don't hold a candle to the fogs we get here in the Bay of Fundy in Maine. Fogs here get so thick you can put a nail through it and hang your hat on it. It's the honest truth. 

My neighbor Dave is a fisherman and can't do any work when a Maine fog comes through. He saves up all of his chores for when it is foggy. One evening, a thick fog came through and Dave knew he wasn't going to be able to work the next day. He decided he needed to shingle his roof. He started to shingle at breakfast and didn't finish until dinner time. As he came in from the house he told his wife, "I didn't realize how long our house I was out there shingling all day." His wife knowing that they have a small house went outside to take a look. Sure enough he had shingled right past the edge of the roof and onto the fog!
