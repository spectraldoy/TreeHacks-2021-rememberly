People loved to talk about London's fog, but it did not compare to Maine's. Maine's fogs were so intense, you could supposedly stick a nail through it. 

There lived a man and his wife. The man fished for a living, but when the Maine fog was too intense for him to fish in, the man would stay home and complete chores he'd been meaning to do for a  while. One day, the fog had come in overnight. So the man couldn't go to work. So, he decided to put shingles on their roof. He worked right after breakfast, up until dinnertime. It took him all day. 

At supper, the husband told his wife that they had an awfully long house. The woman was in disbelief because she knew just how spacious their house was and she didn't believe it could've been as long as her husband said. So, she went outside to see the work he'd done on the roof, only to find out that her husband had shingled the part of their roof that was visible as well as had gone into the fog to finish up the remaining parts. She'd never even known that part of the roof existed!
