The fog in London may be thick, but it doesn't hold a candle up to the fog in Maine. It is so thick that many people can't do their jobs when there is really bad fog. You could hammer a nail into the fog and not notice. I have a friend who is a fisherman, and he saves chores and things to do around the house for when there is bad fog because he can't work. One morning, he woke up and realized the fog was so bad that he wouldn't be able to work, so he decided he would put new shingles on his roof. He ate breakfast and then worked all day until dinner fixing the roof. At dinner, his wife says that he was working for a long time and the husband replies that he did not know their roof was so long! The wife knows that they live in a small house so their roof must not be that large. The wife goes out to check on the work that her husband did, and realizes that he put shingles past the roof and into the fog without noticing.
