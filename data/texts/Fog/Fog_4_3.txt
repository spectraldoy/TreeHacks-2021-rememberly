Some say the English fogs are the thickest fogs. Well, the British fogs don't have anything on the fogs in Maine. Some say they are so thick that you could drill a hole and stick a nail into them.

My neighbor is a fisherman. When there is going to be a thick fog, he uses it as an excuse not to fish and to do house chores instead. This particular day the fog was thick, so he decided he would shingle the roof. He spent from dawn until dusk shingling. When he got back inside, it was time for supper.

He was eating dinner with his wife, and he said, "Wow, we have a long roof! It took me all day to shingle!" His wife, knowing they had a short house, went outside to take a look. To her surprise, her husband had shingled past the roof onto the fog!
