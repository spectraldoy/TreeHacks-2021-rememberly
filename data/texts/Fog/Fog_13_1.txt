England doesn't have anything on us, inregards to the weather.  Particalarly of note  is the fog is so bad.  How bad? The fgog gets so thick you can drive a shingle on to it.

It,s the honest truth



My friend dave work s on afishing boat.  However  one day he couldn't work so decided to shingle his roof.  This took half a day.  At five pm, his wife Samantha comes out and says what have you been shingling,  what are you doing 

We have small house.  Dave looked to see, and it turned out he had shingled past their small roof, and into the fog, much to his suprise





So it turns out, the fog gets so badâ€¦.   Quite a tall tale , out here in Longwood.
