Some people say the fog in London is bad,  but it doesn't  hold a match to the fog in Maine. The fog is so thick that if you take a nail and hammer to it, you could hang your hat.  My neighbor is a fisherman, but when the fog is so thick, he cant go out fishing so he stays home and does housework. One night the fog came in really thick, and the fisherman decided to was too thick. After breakfast with his wife, he decided to reshingle his roof. He set up to the roof just after breakfast and is up there all day until supper. During supper, he tells his wife, "we sure do have a long roof". The wife was surprised to hear him say that because they lived in a little house. After dinner, the wife  suspicious when outside the check on her husbands handy work, and sure enough, he had shingled right onto the fog.
