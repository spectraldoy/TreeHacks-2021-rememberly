The London fog doesn't hold a candle to the fog that comes over the Bay of fundy in maine. It is so thick you could hammer a nail in it and a hang a hat on it. 

There was a fisherman who lived in Maine. When the fog was coming he knew he couldn't fish so he saved all his chores for that day. One day when the fog was really bad he decided to redo the roof. He went out after breakfast and stayed long after dinner. When he eventually came down he said to his wife wow what a long roof we have. She knew that they had a small roof and went outside to check. Her husband had nailed roofing all the way into the fog!!
