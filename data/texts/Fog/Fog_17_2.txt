You can say all you want about the fog in England, but I say, as I stand here there is nothing that compares to the fog in the Bay of Fundy here in Maine.  The fog is so thick that you can drive a nail into it and hang your hat.  It's the honest truth.  



My neighbor Dave is a fisherman on the bay.  When the fog rolls in, fisherman cannot do their jobs.  They tend to save up their chores for a foggy day.  Overnight the fog came rolling in and Dave decided that he could not fish that day.  So, he decided that he would spend the day putting in a new roof.  He started after breakfast and worked until dinner.  



"My, what a mighty long house we have" Dave told his wife Sarah when he was finished.  Sarah knew that they had a small house, so she went outside to take a look.  She was shocked to find out that Dave had shingled the entire house and continued out and put shingles on the fog as well!
