You can say what you want about the thick fogs in England but they are nothing when compared to the density of the  terrible fog in one northern part of Maine. The fog here becomes so thick you cannot work and you can drive a nail into it to hang up your hat. The man in the story works on his fishing boat. When the fog is really bad he is unable to go to work until it clears so he completes his chores at home. 



One foggy day, he decides he will stay home to shingle the roof. He heads up to the roof and doesn't come down until dinner time. When he comes into the house he tells his wife " We have a mightily long roof, it's taking forever to shingle the whole thing". His wife, knowing they have a small home, was skeptical so she went outside to evaluate the situation. She found her husband had shingled the entire roof and beyond it into the fog!
