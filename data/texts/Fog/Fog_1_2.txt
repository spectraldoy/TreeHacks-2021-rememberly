You can say all you want about the thick fogs in London but im telling you as sure as im standing here that they don't hold a candle to the thick fogs that come rolling in over the Bay of fundy here in maine. You can hammer a nail and hang a hat on it, it's the honest truth

My friend dave works on a fishing boat here in maine. He knows when a maine fog comes he will not be doing any work so he always saves up all his chores for that day. Overnight a maine fog came in and dave knew he wouldn't be working. He decided his roof needed shingling. He went up there straight after breakfast and didn't come down until nightful. That night he told his wife sarah "wow we have such a long roof." Sarah knew that they had a small roof and went outside to check and sure enough he had shingled past the roof straight into the fog.
