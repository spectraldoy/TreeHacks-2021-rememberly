I don't care what anyone says New England fogs are much thicker than London fogs. The fog over ______ bay is so thick that you could hammer a nail into it and hang a hat on it. I had a friend who makes a living as fisherman and even he does not go out when the fog is too thick. One day he noticed the fog was rolling in and knew he was not going to be able to go out that day.  So he decided to shingle his house.  He climbed up in the morning and did not come back down until dinner time.  Over dinner he commented to his wife that they sure had a long house.  She looked at him and then went outside.  Her hunch had been correct.  The house had been shingled and at the end of the roof her husband had kept on shingling right onto the fog.
