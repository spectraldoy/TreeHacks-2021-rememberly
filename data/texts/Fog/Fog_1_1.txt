You can say all you want about London Fog but it doesn't hold a candle to the fog here in Maine in the bay of fundy. You can nail something to it and it will stay and that's the honest truth.

My friend is a fisherman in Maine. He knows when the fog comes in he cant work so he saves all his chores for that day. One night the fog came in over night so he thought perfect I can shingle the roof. He stayed up there all day and did not come town until nightfall. He said to his wife wow we have a mighty long roof. His wife knew they had a small roof and went outside to see what he had done. He had nailed shingles all the way past the edge of the roof and into the fog!
