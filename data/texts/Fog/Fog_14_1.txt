You can say all you want about England's thick fogs, but I swear to you, as I'm standing right here, that they've got nothing on Maine fogs. A Maine fog is so thick that you can drive a nail through it and hang up a hat, honest to God!

My friend Dave works on a fishing boat, but when a Maine fog rolls through, he can't do any work. So he saves all his chores up for a day when there's a fog. One time, a fog rolled through overnight so Dave knew he couldn't go to work the next day. He decided his roof need shingling, so he set to shingling it before breakfast and didn't come down until dinner.

"Sarah," he said to his wife over supper, "We sure have a long house, it took me all day to shingle the roof!" Sarah knew their house was small, so she took a look outside. Sure enough, she saw that Dave had shingled past the roof and out onto the fog!
