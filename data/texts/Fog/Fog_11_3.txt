Some people say that the fog in new England is bad, but it is nothing compared to the fog in a certain town in Maine. The fog here is so thick that you can put a nail in it and hang your hat on it! A certain fisherman would go out each day unless the fog was really bad and then he would come home. One day when the fog was especially thick he decided to tile his roof. He worked all day until dawn and then came in for dinner. As he and his wife ate he commented about how long he was out there. "I don't remember us having such a long house! I was out there all day putting up tile". His wife went outside to take a look at his work, and to her surprise, he had tiled all the way past the edge of the house onto the fog!
