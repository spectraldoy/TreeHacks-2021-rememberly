People say that the fog in England is terrible, but they have never seen the fog that rolls off of the Bay in Maine. It is so thick that you can pound a nail into it and hang your hat on it! 

There was a man named David who owned a fishing boat on that bay in Maine. However, when the fog got thick he could not go out to sea. One morning, he noticed the fog rolling in and decided to stay home. After breakfast, he went out and reshingled the roof. He spent all day working on the project. When he finally came inside for dinner he said to his wife Sarah, "wow our house is much larger than I thought. That took me all day!". But Sarah knew that they had a small house so she went out to see the work he had done. Turns out he shingled the whole roof and then kept working out onto the fog!
