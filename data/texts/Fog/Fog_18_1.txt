Some say that the fogs in England are the worst. But I'm telling you, as sure as I'm standing here, that the fogs that come over Fundy Bay in Maine are the worst fogs you'll ever see. You can drive a nail into and hang your hat on it its so thick. 

	My neighbor Dave runs a fishing boat. He can't go out fishing when there's a fog because the fog is so thick. One night, a fog rolled in and he decided he couldn't go out fishing. Instead, he decided to put shingles on his roof. 

	He went up early in the morning to put shingles on his roof and didn't come down until the sun set. He said to his wife "We have a mighty long roof!" She knows for fact that their house is rather tiny, so when she went out to look he shingled the roof and continued shingling right into the fog so it extended past the house!
