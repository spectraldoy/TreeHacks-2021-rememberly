You can say all you want about the fog in England, but it does not compare to the fog in Fundy Bay in Maine.  When the fog rolls in, it is so thick that you cannot work outside.  Most fisherman save up their chores for a foggy day.  This is the honest truth.  



One day, the fog came into the bay and my friend Dave couldn't work.  He decided to do some chores.  He decided that the roof needed new shingles, so he started to shingle the roof.  He started after breakfast and did not come down until dinner.  



Dave told his wife Sarah,  "Boy, do we sure have a long roof!"  Sarah looked at Dave with a funny look.  She knew that they had a short room.  When they looked outside, they saw that Dave had shingled the entire roof and continued out into the fog!
