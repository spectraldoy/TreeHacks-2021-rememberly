The narrator claims that Maine fogs are worse than London fogs, saying that when a Maine fog rolls in over the lake, the fog is so thick that people's daily lives are affected and that you could drive a nail through it a hang up your hat.

	To back this claim up, they recount a time when a Maine fog rolled in overnight, so their friend Dave couldn't go to work out on the lake as a fisherman. But, Dave had always saved his household chores for foggy days like this, so that day he decided to re-shingle the roof. He got up onto the roof right after breakfast and didn't come down until supper time.

	Over supper, he remarked to his wife, "Our house sure is long, it took me a whole day to shingle the roof!" His wife knew that their house wasn't long, so she went outside to investigate. Sure enough, she was surprised to see that Dave had continued shingling right off the roof and out onto the fog!
