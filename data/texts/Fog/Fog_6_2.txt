You can say all you want to about England's  think fog, but it does not hold a candle to the fog in the Bay of Fundy in Maine. That's the honest truth. Some same if you walk out into the fog you can hammer a nail into it and hang your hat.

My neighbor owns a fishing boat,  and can't take his boat out on foggy days. He leave his chores for foggy days. One night the fog came in heavy and my neighbor decided to catch up on chores. He roof needed shingling, so after breakfast he went up the roof and didn't come down until dinner. He says to his wife "we sure do have a long roof". His wife, knowing that they had a small house, went outside to look at the roof, and sure enough he had shingled right past the edge of the house right onto the fog.
