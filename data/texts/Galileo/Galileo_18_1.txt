Galileo lived in the 17th century, and helped revolutionize science. For a long time before him, logic was the insrument of science, and math was for music. (Something about Pythagoras and whole tones...) His dad was a musician, and so was he, so he began to fuse them together and did experiments that let him do calculations to figure new things out. He did many things, including finding Jupiter's moon with a telescope. He went to university but left because of financial reasons, and then was hired into another university. There, he met a girl and had 3 kids, 2 girls and a boy. He legitimized the boy but sent the girls to a nunnery. The mom remarried but Galileo stayed on good terms with them. Eventually, Galileo came out as a strong supporter of heliocentrism, AKA the belief that the planets revolve around the sun. Pope Urban VIII (?) approved of him publishing a book discussing this (called something like Discourse on the Two Views of the), on the condition that his view (that everything revolves around the Earth) be included. Galileo did include that view, but as the view of a character names Simplicus who was dumb. That made the Pope mad and Galileo was accused of heresy, and was placed under house arrest until he died in 16-something.
