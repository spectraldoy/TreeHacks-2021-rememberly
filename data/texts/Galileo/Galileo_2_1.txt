Galileo G was a astronomist, philosopher, and physicist in the 17th century. He was famous for introducing quantitative research methods to solve problems. Logic was previously the deciding factor. Galileo learned mathematics from his father, a musician famous for using mathematics in his work. Galileo's true passion was astrology and he was famous for discovering the moons circling Jupiter. He was a supporter of heliocentrism and wrote a book defending this theory in 1632. Pope Urban VIII promoted the publication of this book but in exchange for his support he wanted his theory of geocentrism mentioned in the book also.

Galileo had 3 illegitimate children - 2 daughters and 1 son. He sent the daughters to a convent and supported his son
