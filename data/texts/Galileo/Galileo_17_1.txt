Galileo was a prominent astronomist and mathematician in the seventeenth century. He lived in Italy and became fascinated with mathematics as a result of his father's occupation of being a music theorist, for he explored the srosses between music and mathematics. However, Galileo became more interested in astronomy, and when he enrolled in the Univesity of Pisa he build a telescope that was the first one to function. He transferred to the University of Padua for financial reasons, where he met a woman and had three illegitimate children with her, including Virginia and Vincenzia. He could not rpovide the dowry for Vicenzia, and the woman he loved ended up marrying another man. Galileo was moved to the Court of Medici soon thereafter. Galileo was a supported of the heliocentric theory, because he was able to see the moons of Jupiter and believed that the world did not revolve around the earth; rather, around the sun. Originally one of his biggest supporters was Pope Urban VIII, and Galileo published a book with his permission about the findings. The Pope wanted a character that held his beliefs included in the publication, so Galileo named this character Superlius. This character was generally received as a fool, which angered the Pope, who put Galileo under house arrest for his heretic beliefs in 1633. In 1642, he died still under house arrest.
