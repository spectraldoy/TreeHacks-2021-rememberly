He was the son of Vencizo Galilei, who was a musian responsible for experimentally deducing the progression of chords by experimenting on a string. His use of scientific methods was adopted by Galileo, who, in turn, conducted numerous, extremely defined and meticulous scientific experiments, and ran mathematical analysis on the results of. He is, as a result, responsible for quantitative analysis and measurement in the sciences during a time where logic dominated the sciences and scientific method. Though he was a philospher, he was far more entranced by astronomy. He was responsible for not only the building of the first telescope with the capability to see out to Jupiter, but also the discovery of Jupiter's moons, which went directly against the earth centric model of the catholic church.
