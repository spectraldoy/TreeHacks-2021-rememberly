Galileo Galilie was an important figure of the scientific revolution of the seventheenth century. He was one of the first individuals to use a telescope. He incorporated math into the discipline of science, but astronomy was his true passion. He attended a university but had to leave because of financial reasons, but received a position at another university. He had 3 illegitimate children, one of which he legitimized. He believed in the theory of heleocentrism, which is the idea that the planets revolve around the sun. This theory was not supported during his time. The Pope at the time was one of his biggest supporters and allowed Galileo to publish a book on the condition that he incorporate some of the Pope's ideas into his writing. Galileo created the character Simplicus after the Pope, and this character supported heleocentrism and came off sounding foolish. Because of this, Galileo lost the Pope's support and was put under house arrest for the remainder of his life.
