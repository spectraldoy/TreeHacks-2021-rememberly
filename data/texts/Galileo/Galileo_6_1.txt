Galelio was a scientist in the 1600s. He grew up learning about math and logic from music and music theory, as his father was a musician. He went to the University of Piza for a while and made the strongest telescope and studied / found Jupiter's moons. He ended up having to drop out of school because of money but then got hired as a professor at the University of Padua. He had a thing with a girl named Maria and had three kids with her. He claimed the son as Christian through the church (I didn't really understand this part I'm Jewish sorry) but did not claim the daughters because he wouldn't be able to afford dowries. He was on the Medici court. Maria then married another guy and seemed happy, and Galelio and Maria stayed friendly. Galelio invented heliocentricism - the idea that the planets revolve around the sun and not the Earth. To get permission to publish a book about this the Pope said that Galelio needed to include the Pope's views (which were anti heliocentricism) in it as well. The book was published in 1632. Galelio made fun of the Pope's views, and called them simple. The Pope got super angry, charged Galelio with heresay in 1633, and put him in house arrest until he died almost a decade later.
