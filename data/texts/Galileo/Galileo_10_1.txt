Galileo Galilei was an astronomer from the 17th century. He was initially interested in math and how it interacted with music. His father was a musician. Galileo went to college, but he could not afford it and was forced to drop out. He then began his astronomy career. He met a young woman and had three illegitimate children with her. He was actually able to get one child legitimized through the church since he would not be able to afford dowries for all of his daughters. 

Galileo went against the widely-held geocentric belief that the planets revolved around Earth. He discovered heliocentrism when he observed moons orbiting around Jupiter or Saturn. He observed these moons with a telescope that he made, which was able to see further than any other telescope at the time. 

One of Galileo's biggest supporters was Pope Urban VIII. Galileo was allowed by the pope to publish his views on heliocentrism, as long as the geocentric view was included as well. Galileo portrayed the geocentric view with a character called Simplicius who was portrayed as a fool. Pope Urban got angry, and Galielo was placed under house arrest in 1633. He remained in house arrest until his death in 1642.
