Galileo's father was a musician and discovered, through experimentation, the indirect relationship between pitch and string taughtness. Galileo built a telescope that surpassed any other that had been built before it. He studied astronomy at Pisa and later met and married a woman with two daughters (whom he, when he moved, sent them to convent school) and one son. He wrote a book about his geocentric view, and the pope asked- in exchange for funding- his views be put into the book. Galileo created a character named Supercious, who said foolish things. Because of this, the pope tried Galileo for heresey and spent the majority of his remaining  life (9 years) under house arrest.
