Galileo was one of the first scientists to use mathmatics over logic, which was the prevailing theory of thought at the time. Mathmatics was rare but was used in music theory, where something was in whole number ratios. Galileo's father was a musician and music theorist who did experiments on strings to determine that something with pitch could be in fractional ratios. Galileo learned math from his dad and went on to study at the university of pauda. There he was able to develop the first telescope that saw the entire night sky, but he had to drop out for financial reasons. He later took up a post as a professer at a different university, where he made other strides, like discovering one of jupiter's moons. While he was there he met a woman whom he fathered 3 illegitimate children with. Two of the children were sent off somewhere, while the third was legitimized. This unequal treatment happened because Galileo didn't have enough money for the dowerys to legitimize them all according to his standing in the Medici court. The mother of his children went on to marry someone else, but the three of them were cordial. Galileo went on to advocate for heliocentrism and publish a book on the topic. The pope at the time allowed this despite the view being contrary to the church's, but made Galileo mention the pope's views in the book. Galileo did this by expressing the pope's views through the character simplicus. Simplicus was portrayed as a fool in the book, so Galileo was put on house arrest in 1633 until his death in 1647 for heresay.
