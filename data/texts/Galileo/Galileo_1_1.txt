Gallileo was an astromer, physicist, and philospher in the 17th century. There wasn't much about logic in science at the time. Gallileo was really good at math. His father was a musician and shared that with his son. 

Gallileo's true passion was with astronomy. He went to University of Pisa were he studied astronomy and built a telescope. He then went to go on to teach at University of Purdua. He married Mariana Gamba and had 3 illegitimate children with her. He was able to get one Duke of Tuscany to legitimize his daughter Vincenza. Mariana remarried and Gallileo kept cordial relations with them. 

Gallileo was criticized for his astro something theory, which says that the sun orbits the earth. He wrote a book called Discovery something (I don't remember) explaining this. His one friend, heger, supported him and wanted to be a part of the book so he named the character Simplicius but that character was considered foolish. His friend heger was insulted and Gallileo lost a very supportive and resourceful friend. Th
