I was shopping at my local supermarket as I normally have for years.  One particular day, I had done about 2 weeksâ€™ worth of shopping and was headed toward the register to pay for my groceries. I reached into my back right pocket to grab the money to pay and noticed that there was no money in there.  I started to get nervous.  I knew my pocket book was in the car and I was sure I had put the money in my back right pocket. I look at cashier with a confused look, not knowing what to do.  There were people behind me on the line and I immediately thought about the money I left in the car that was intended to pay rent this month. She told me to speak with the courtesy counter.  I laughed and said, "But it was cash, no one would hand that in!"  
I decided that there was no harm in checking so I walked up to a women behind the counter and said "I have to ask, did anyone turn in cash by any chance?" She asked "How much?"  My face then lit up.  "$200 in the form of twenty dollar bills." I replied.  She said, "Actually, yes, someone did!"  I was so surprised! "Who? I want to thank them."  She points to a young girl about 10 years old and says, "She did." I walked over to the mom and hugged her. She said, "It wasn't me, it was my daughter". I was so happy, I was almost in tears. I decided in those moments to do my duty to pay forward this act of kindness every opportunity I had.
