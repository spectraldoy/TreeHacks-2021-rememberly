The KGB was a security system that was used by the Soviet Union. Its purpose was to protect its citizens as well as counter and liquidate any organizations, companies, etc. that went against the Soviet's beliefs. It attempted to match a program that was used in Great Britain, but lacked the necessary artificial intelligence that gave Great Britain an advantage up until the Cold War. Instead, the Soviet Union relied on human intelligence. One of the generals attempted to use the programs of the KGB to overthrow Krushchev, the president of the Soviet Union at one point in its history. After this attempt, the president disbanded the KGB and created two other programs to separate the tasks. However, one of the programs is still similar to the KGB.
