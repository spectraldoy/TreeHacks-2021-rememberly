The KGB in Soviet Russia was analogous to the US' Central Intellegence Agency. The had a motto of "sword and shield," the shield to protect the Soviet Union and the sword to banish its foes. The KGB had a variety of functions, such as counterintellegence, border security, and protection of state treasures. The KGB did not rival the British MI6, who were more technologically advanced because of signal intellegence. The KGB had to stick to human intellegence from forigen spies, but when border security tightened in other countries they had to up their technological advances, which experienced a financial windfall during the cold war. Someone came into power after the cold war and relaxed the KGB's anti-soviet supression efforts, which lead to the publication of some anti KGB critical books. Then someone else came to power and the leader of the KGB (Yuri?) tried to implement a coup. That failed, and gorbachev ordered the dismantelment of the KGB effective immediately. The KGB is now broken up into three different parts, each with different fuctions, although one group still acts similarly to the original KGB.
