This passge is about the KGB. They were essentially the CIA of the Soviet Union. They were super big in the Cold War. They worked to collect internal and external information. They did not like dissenters and were mean to them. They rivaled SIS / M16 in England, but M16 was better at applying / using the information that they gathered. The KGB used a lot of human intelligence from illegal immigrants, but when countries started getting stricter on immigration the KGB switched to electronic intelligence. They then sold this to help businesses. There were a bunch of guys with really long names. One of them who became president was much more lax about dissent and let some other guy publish a book about a guy named Ivan. Then he died and things unrelaxed again. Later, the KGB didn't like the president in 1991 and tried to do a coup but they failed and then the KGB got in trouble and was dissolved and split into two separate organizations. One still does internal info like the old KGB and the other does something else
