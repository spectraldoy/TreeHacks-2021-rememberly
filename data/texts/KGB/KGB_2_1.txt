The Soviet Union formed the KGB in 1957. The KGB was based on Great Britain's SIS (MI6). The KGB provided security for the communist leaders and specialized in espionage. The KGB could not keep up with advancements in signals espionage, so they specialized in human espionage receiving tips mainly from illegal citizens. The KGB persecuted anyone not supportive of the communist cause and limited any reading/ene. The KGB made major advancements in electronic espionage and capitalized on this making a significant profit after the Cold War by selling this technology to industries. The KGB was dissolved in 1991 after a foiled attempt to overthrown Mikhail Gorbachev. It was replaced with a new system focused on national leader/border security rather than anti-communist persecution.
