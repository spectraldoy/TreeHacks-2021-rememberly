The KGB was the premier intelligence and espionage force in the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. It was preceded by the Cheka, and its purpose was to gather foreign intelligance as well as to eradicate any dissent against the Soviet Union from within its borders. It ran by the "sword and shield" motto--the shield as protecting the state, while the sword vanquished any dissenters. This intelligence agency performed the same tasks as the CIA and Britain's SIS (also known as MI6), but it lacked the technological advancements in technology that allowed for the other agencies to flourish and gather more itnelligence. As a consequence, the KGB relied mostly on human intelligence, mostly from illegal civilians that would be sent ot foreign countries. But as these aforementioned countries tightened their security, the KGB was unable to move around their human agents. This spurred the development of advanced technologies that also leaked into the business sector for the state. The KGB would eliminate anyone within the state seen as a threat who did not believe in the ideology of the country or who pushed for change. Once Krushchev became president, the censorship and other laws were relaxed, and some material that was previously disallowed was published, such as A Day in the Life of Ivan. After Krushchev, however, there was a member of the KGB that disapproved of him and staged a coup against him. The KGB was too weak to stage a successful coup, and this general ended up arrested. Once the next leader, Gorbachev, was put in power, the KGB was broken up into the SVR and another group that conducts the same sort of foreign and domestic intelligence.
