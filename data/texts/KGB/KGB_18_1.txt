The KGB was the Soviet intelligence agency, like the CIA in the US. They were good at gaining intelligence, but didn't have enough analysis skills to keep up with the SIS (AKA MI6) in the UK, for example, especially in regards to communications technology. As a result, they focused a lot on external espionage and counter espionage. Later in the KGB's life, it became harder to spy because everybody was cracking down on protection measures. So, the KGB started focusing more on technology. Another facet of the KGB was the suppression of anti-revolutionaries/non-communist ideology within the USSR. This his its peak with Yuri, whose era was similar to that of Stalin. After Yuri, though, Nikita Kruschev came to power and loosened the USSR up a little bit. After his time, I think it got harsh again. Finally, Gorbachev came to power and really loosened up the State -- to the point where the KGB started planning to overthrow him. This failed and as a result the head of the KGB was replaced and the KGB was split into 2 distinct organizations. Something happened on November 6 1991
