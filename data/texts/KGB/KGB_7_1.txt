The KGB was the name given to broad intelligence system similar to SIS/MI6 of Britain in terms of intelligence aquisition and volume, but could not compare to it in terms of analysis, a fact which greatly hindered them until the cold war in 1957. Up until then, and in the early days of the cold war, the KGB had largely focused on 'human' intelligence (that is, spies, espeionage, reverse espionage, etc.) from illegal residents in the USSR and abroad. However, as a result of stricter policies abroad, the KGB turned their efforts and focus to technological espionage. The KGB acted as a secret police of sorts, acting as a 'sword and shield' of the parties' beliefs and idiologies. They worked to suppress unorthodox beliefs and eliminate dissidence/dissidents, as well as secure borders, and dissolve dissending groups both within the USSR and outside of its borders. However, when Kruschev came to power in 1961, he did away with the more Stalin-esq policies of his predecessor, and the KGB relaxed, allowing for more self expression and even anti-communist rhetoric, organizations and works to be published during his time as premire. However, when he left office, the next premier returned the state to its status quo of suppression well into 1991. Eventually, after threat of crackdown against the USSR, the KGB was disbanded in the 1990s, and became two separate entities: one with an emphasis on border control, and the other operating in a way similar to the original KGB.
