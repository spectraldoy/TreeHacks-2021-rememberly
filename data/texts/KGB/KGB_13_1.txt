There was an umberlla association named HKG that worked for the Soviet Union to collect information and secure the country. But unlike MI6 from Britain, HKG does not have a strong ability other than using the human intelligence network. They were once strict about the control over citizens' thought to eliminate all anti-communists opinions, but such restriction was relaxed after a publication of novel in 1962. After the president lost the power, HKG went back to its strict functioning till 1991 when Soviet Union broke.
