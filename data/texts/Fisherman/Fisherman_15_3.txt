Once there was a fisherman who lived alone in a shack. Naturally he was surprised to find his door open after a day of unsuccessful fishing. Upon further observation, he was shocked to see a bear rummaging through his honey pot. He screamed. The bear, startled, ran out the house with his paw covered in honey. 



The bear ran to the pond to wash his hand, attracting flies in the process. Fish after fish were biting at his paw, so he systematically flung them to the shore. Soon there were rows of fish. The bear ate his fill. The fisherman watched from a distance. The bear, seeing him, left the remaining fish, seemingly out of sympathy. The man thanked the bear, and had enough fish to last him for a spell.
