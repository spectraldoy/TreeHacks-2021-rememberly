An old man goes to the lake.

It was a nice spring  afternoon.  

There he meets a large black bear.  The. bear greeted the man by standing. Hi

The bear spills a large tub of honey.  The honey oozed all over the ground.  

The honey spills all over and attracts flies,  other insects, and all sort of bugs.

The flies buzzed about, drawn by the sweet smelling honey. 

Then, a trout flies hopping out of  the water, attracted to the scene by the flies.

The fisherman and bear rejoice, as it turns out the black bear was getting paid, in the form of the large trout they caught.
