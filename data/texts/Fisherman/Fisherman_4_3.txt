Once upon a time there was a fisherman. He was fishing in the river and did not catch anything. Upon arriving to his home, he saw something in his shed. Being the curious man that he was, he peered in to see what was going on. To his surprise, there was a huge bear! The bear was eating his molasses. He tipped over the bottle and molasses was a sticky mess on the floor, and he moved it around with his paw. The man screamed which startled the bear. The bear ran out, with his paw up in the air.

As the bear approached the river, his paw attracted flies. These flies attracted fish which jumped out to eat the flies. As the fish jumped out, the bear swatted them away, making a pile of fish to eat. The man watched in the bushes in awe as the bear swatted away the fish. The bear looked at the man and left a pile of fish, then ran away to watch from the corner. The man then approached the fish. Sure enough, the bear had left 6 large trout for the man to eat! The man thought, wow. This is the first time a bear has ever paid me for molasses! Since then, the man vowed never hunt bears again.
