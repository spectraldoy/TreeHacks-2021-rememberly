One day a fisherman was out fishing on his favorite lake and he just wasn't catching any fish that day. Finally he just gave up and headed to his fishing shack. When he got there the front door was open, and being of a suspicious nature he went to go inspect the situation. He was shocked to see a bear, just sitting there, going through his jars of jelly. The bear started when the man screamed and ran off, smearing his paw along the ground. The bear waded into the lake on his hind legs, so his paws were in the air. As he waved the jelly- covered paw, flies and bugs and thing stuck to it. Suddenly a trout jumped up to get the bugs, and the bear swatted it to the shore. The fisherman's stomach grumbled from the bushes where he was hiding. He'd only had toast and left- over jelly for dinner. The bear looked over to wear the man was hiding, and arranged the fish in a line. He then went over to the woods. The man saw that the bear had left him six fish! "Well," he said, "that's the first time a bear has ever paid me for my jelly!" The bear nodded and disappeared into the woods. The man never hunted bears again.
