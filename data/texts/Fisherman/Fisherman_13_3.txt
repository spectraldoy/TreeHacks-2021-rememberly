Once upon a time,  there lived a fisherman, a bear, and a trout in a cozy little town in Maine.  One day the old man, who was retired army went to go hunting at his cabin in Maine.  When he reached his small rustic cabin, he found the door ajar and molasses jars spilled and a messed.  He turned around, and spotted a big black bear.   The molasses being spilled attracted all sorts of flies and insects.  And those attracted insects, attracted some trout to come jumping in.,,, whoosh.  The bear ate a trout and continued to catch the fish.  The old man had nothing except old bread and whatever molasses hadn't spilled.  However, after the bear ate his half dozen trout, he shared his catch with the old man.   The old man decided he would no longer hunt black bears, and was grateful that he had not shot him.
