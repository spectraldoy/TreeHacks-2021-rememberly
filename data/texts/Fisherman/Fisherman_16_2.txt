One day a old fisherman was visiting his favorite lake in Maine, when he encountered a bear inside his shack. The bear had pulled the cork out of his jar of molasses, and dropped the jar on the floor after the surprised man screamed in shock upon observing the bear. After smearing his paw around in a puddle of molasses on the floor, the bear ventured down to the lake and began waving his sticky paw in the air, attracting many flies and bugs.



Subsequently, a large trout leapt out of the water to catch the flies, followed by half a dozen other trout. After flinging the fish onto the lake shore, the bear left the remaining fish (6 total) in a row for the fisherman, who had been hidden behind a bush on shore. 



Moments later, the man cautiously crept to the shore to enjoy the fish, and waved to the bear in the distance before he lumbered off.  Given his hunger and limited success catching fish himself that day, the man gratefully acknowledged the bear and remarkedâ€¦From that day formward, the man never hunted bears again.
