One fine day a Maine fisherman was fishing at the lake, with little luck.  Giving up, he went to his home and found his door open.  Being of a suspicious nature, he looked into the open door and found a big black bear inside.  The bear had a jar of molasses in his paw.  It was uncorking the jar with it's teeth.  As the jar was opened, the bear thrust his paw into the jar, covering it with the sticky sweet molasses.  



The fisherman hid down near the river.  The bear left the cabin and swung his giant paw into the air.  From all around, flies, bugs and mosquitoes came to taste the sticky sweet solution on his paw.  The bear then went into the river and continued to swing his paw about.  Trout from the river leaped out of the water lured out by the insects, and the bear snatched them up with the his other paw.



The fisherman watched from behind his bush.  He was saddened by what he saw, only having a slice of bread to eat and what was left of the molasses.  When the bear had finished catching the trout, he laid 6 on the side of the river.
