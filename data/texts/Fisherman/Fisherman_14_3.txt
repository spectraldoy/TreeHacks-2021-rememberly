Once there was an old Maine man who liked to fish in a lake. One day, he had no luck at all with fishing and decided to give up and head back to his fishing shack. When he approached the shack however, he saw that the front door was open. When he looked inside, he saw a big black bear with the cork to his molasses jar in its teeth. The man yelled, startling the bear and causing it to spill the molasses all over the floor and smearing its paws in the mess.

The bear ran out of the shack and towards the lake. It stood on the shore on its hind legs and soon a bunch of mosquitoes, flies, and other bugs swarmed around it molasses-covered paw. The bear waded into the lake with its paw outstretched over the surface, and suddenly, a large trout jumped out trying to eat the bugs on its paw. The bear swatted the fish aside onto the shore, and soon another trout followed and another until the bear had a big pile of fish. It ate half a dozen fish as the man watched from behind the bushes, his stomach growling for he had only had some bread and molasses that morning. The bear though lined up half a dozen trout on the shore before
