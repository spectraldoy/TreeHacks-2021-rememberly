One fine long day, there was a fisherman who went fishing at his favorite lake in Maine. He spent all day fishing and catching, looking for his favorite fish, the trout. After a long time, he had not had any luck yet. 



He then went to the nearby fishing shack and heard a loud noise. Being of a suspicious type, he went cautiously into the fishing stack to find a big black bear with his paw in a jar of molasses. He kept sticking his paw into the jar and then licking the sticky molasses off of his paw.  He then went into the woods, where bugs and mosquitoes swarmed around his paw, as they smelled the delicious scent of molasses. 



The bear then went down to the lake and stuck his paw into the water. The molasses on his paw attracted fish from all around the lake. They jumped up out of the water as they neared him. The fisherman was watching from the words. The bear then stuck his paw in and scooped up a fish, plopping it down onto the shore. One by one, he continued the process as a pile of fish stacked up on the shore.
