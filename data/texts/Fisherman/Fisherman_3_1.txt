There was an old man who had gone fishing but was catching nothing. Finally, he just gave up and went back to his fishing shack. When he got here, he saw that the front door. Being of a suspicious nature, he looked inside. There was a big bear eating his molasses. He was just uncorking his jar and scooping it out. The old man screamed. The bear startled and walked out to the lake front and waded into the water. Bugs and Flies and mosquitoes stuck to the sticky sweet paw, and the bear swatted them away. As he did, a trout jumped out to get the bugs and bear swatted it to the shore. This happened again, and each time it did that bear swatted the trout onto a pile on the shore.

The old man had caught nothing, and all he ate for dinner was some bread and the left over molasses. He stomach rumbled as he watched the bear swat fish onto the shore. The bear looked at the bushes where the old man was hidden. He laid out six trout in a line, and ambled off into the woods. "Well," said the old man, "that's the first time a bear has ever paid me".
