One fine day a man from Maine was fishing on his favorite lake but was catching very little. Finally, he gave up and walked along the lake back to his fishing hut. When he got there, the door was open and being of a suspicious nature, he approached the house with caution. He saw a big black bear pulling the cork out of his jar of molasses with his teeth. The man screamed and startled the bear. The bear spilled the molasses all over the floor and started spreading it everywhere. The bear ran away from the cabin to the lake. Because his paws were covered in molasses, he was attracting flies, mosquitoes, and other bugs which were sticking to the molasses. When the bear entered the water, a large trout jumped out of the water to catch the bugs. When this happened, the bear swatted the trout to the shore. This kept happening, and eventually, the bear had a huge pile of trout. He ate about a half a dozen trout and the man watched, as he was upset, because his stomach was growling. All he had to eat was a piece of bread and some of the leftover molasses. Finally, the bear saw the old man hiding in the bushes and lined up six trout and walked away. The man came up and realized the bear left the trout for him and thanked the bear. This was the first time a bear had ever paid him for his molasses. He vowed never to hunt bears again.
