One fine day an old fisherman went to his cabin after catching no fish. He found the cabin door open. Being of a suspicious nature, he checked for an intruder. What he saw was a bear eating his molasses. Startled, the bear ran out of the cabin, knocking over the molasses jar while retreating.



The bear ran to the riverside to wash his sticky paw. The paw attracted a big trout. The bear flung the trout all the way to the surface. Soon another fish jumped at the sight of the paw.  The bear threw each trout in succession.



Soon the bear had dozens of fish lined up at the shore. He had eaten half a dozen. The old man watched from the bushes, having caught nothing. Seeing him, the bear lined up the remaining fish in a stack.



"Thank you," said the old man to the bear, who waved a sticky, furry paw at him. He vowed to never hunt bears again.
