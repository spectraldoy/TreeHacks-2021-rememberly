One fine day there was a man fishing in a lake in Maine. He was catching very little. He gave up and walked back to his fishing shack. When he got close, he realized that the front door of the shack was open. When he got closer he looked inside and saw a big black bear. The bear had taken the molasses jar and dropped it to the floor then stuck his paw in the pool of molasses, spreading it around. The man let out a loud scream, which startled the bear who ran down to the water. The bear held up his paw with the molasses on it and soon many bugs were swarming around his hand. He then waded into the water. Soon a very large trout swam up to the bear's paw which had the molasses on it and the bear swatted the trout out of the water and onto the shore where it flopped around. Soon another trout came up to him and the bear swatted it to the shore just like the last one. This happened again and again and soon the bear had a large pile. The bear then exited the water and began to eat the trout he had gotten out of the water. The man watched the bear eat his trout and his stomach was rumbling as he was hungry and did not catch anything. For dinner, the fisherman had bread and the molasses that was left. When the bear was finished eating, he looked towards the bushes where the fisherman was hiding. He then laid out the remaining trout in a line and walked away down the shore. The man went up to the fish and yelled "thank you" after the bear. The bear turned around and waved with his now clean paw. The fisherman said, "well this is the first time I've ever been paid back for my molasses". The fisherman never hunted another bear again.
