One day an old man went fishing out on his favorite lake. He heard a noise from his shack and returned to glance inside the door, given his suspicious nature. The man observed a large black bear inside the kitchen, pulling the cork out of his jar of molasses. After the man shrieked in fright, the bear knocked the jar to the floor. He watched the large black bear reaching into his jar of molasses and smearing his paw on the puddle that formed on the floor.



The man had caught few fish that day, but watched in hunger as the black bear caught dozens of fish in the river. The bear attracted various insects by waving his sticky paw around in the air. Consequently, the bear caught many fish who leapt onto his sticky paw, and flung the fish onto the lake shore.



Eventually, the bear left 6 fish on the shore for the man, who had remained hidden in the bushes.
