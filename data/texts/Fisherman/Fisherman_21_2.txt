One fine day an Old Maine man went fishing in his favorite lake and caught very little.  He went back to his old fishing shack and heard something. Being a suspicion man, he crept through the door the saw a big black bear.  The bear had his teeth in the cork of a jar of molasses. Having startled the bear, he spilled the jar of molasses and wiped his paw in it, smearing it all over. 

	The bear ran down to the shore and waded into the water. He kept his paw above the water as to not get his paw wet.  The paw was stick and covered with bugs and mosquitoes and flies.  As he was waving his paw, a large trout jumped out of the water to try to catch some of the bugs. The bear swatted the trout and flung him onto the shore.  He did this many times until he had a pile of fish.

	The fishermen watched the bear from some hidden bushes. He had caught very little that day and had nothing to eat except for some bread and the rest of the molasses. As he watched, his stomach rumbled. 	

	The bear noticed the old man and brought up the remaining trout. He lined them up in front of the bushes.
