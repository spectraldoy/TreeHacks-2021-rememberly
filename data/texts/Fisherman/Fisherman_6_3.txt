One warm day a man decided to got fishing on the lake in maine. After a while he realized he was not having any luck and decided he would call it a day and head back to his cabin. As he approached the cabin, he noticed the door was open. He approached the door and saw a bear eating his last jar of molasses and rubbing his bear claws in the honey on the floor. He screamed and startled the  bear causing him to stand on his back legs and run out of the cabin. As the bear was running, flys were attracted the the honey and stuck to his paws. He went the the edge of the lake to wash his paws and a trout jumped out and he swatted it on the land. Then another trout jumped out, and again he swatted it. After a while, there was a pile of fish on the land. The bear noticed the fisherman looking from being a bush. He took a fish and layed it out. After a while he laid out 6 fish for the man. He man never hunted b
