One fine day an old Maine man was fishing at the shore.  He was having little luck catching fish.  He went home to his house and heard a rumble.  All of a sudden, he saw a big black bear standing in his house.  Inside the fisherman's The bear uncorked a jar of molasses and stuck his humongous paw inside the jar.   The bear began to wave his hand around.  At once, the old fisherman saw flies flock to the bear's paw.  The bear then went to the water and put his paw in the water.  Trout started to jump out of the water as the bear caught 12 trout, while the fisherman caught none.   The fisherman had little to eat but a slice of bread and his stomach was rumbling.  As the bear finished, the fisherman saw the bear had left six fish for him on the shore.  The fisherman said, "Well that's the first time anyone has paid me for my molasses."  After that day, the fisherman never hunted bears again.
