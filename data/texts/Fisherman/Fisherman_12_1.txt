One day there was an old man fisherman who had been unsuccessful catching fish that day. So he returned home, only to see that his door was not as he had left it. He pushed open the door and saw a big black bear eating out of his jar of molasses. The fisherman screamed and the bear got frightened and ran to shore. On the shore, it lifted its molasses-filled paw in the air and soon bugs and flies were swarming its arm trying to get a taste of the molasses. Then, the trout from the water jumped out and kept trying to attack the flies surrounding the molasses paw, but the black bear swatted at them each time, killing them. Within a short bit of time, the bear had killed enough trout to have a pile of them. The bear ate the trout while the old man looked on, hungrily. 



The bear looked over and saw the old man then he proceeded to place the remaining fish he had left in a line, and left. The fisherman approached the meal and saw the bear had left him 6 trout. That was the first time a bear had compensated for his molasses. Because of this, the fisherman never hunted another bear again.
