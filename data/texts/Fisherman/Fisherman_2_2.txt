One fine day an old Maine man was fishing on his favorite lake and was catching very little. He eventually gave up and walked back to his fishing shack. When he got closer, he noticed that the front door was open. Being of a suspicious nature, the man crept closer and looked inside. There was a large bear that was just pulling the cork out of his molasses bottle with his teeth. Then the bottle spilled all over the floor and the bear rubbed its paw in the molasses, smearing it all around. 

	Upon seeing the bear, the man let out a loud scream that startled the bear and caused it to run down towards the water.  The bear then stood on its hind legs and held up its paw. Soon all of the bugs and flies and mosquitoes flew towards the sticky sweet paw. The bear waded into the water and placed the sticky hand with flies on it above the water. Soon there was a large trout who jumped out of the water trying to get the flies on the paw. The bear swatted the trout as it jumped out of the water and it landed on shore where it flopped around. Then another large trout came and the bear did the same thing. Soon the bear had a large pile of fish. 

	The man watched the bear eat half a dozen of the large fish. The man was very hungry and his stomach was rumbling as he had caught nothing. For dinner he had some bread and the molasses that was left over. Suddenly the bear looked towards the bushes where the man was hiding. He then stood up and laid the remaining fish in a line. Then he got up and walked down the shore. 

	The man walked to the line of fish. Sure enough, the bear had left him six large trout. The bear stood at the edge of the forest waiting and watching. The man yelled "thanks a lot" and the bear waved a now clean paw at him and walked into the thicket. The man turned back to the fish and said, "well, that's the first time a bear has ever paid me back for my molasses." The man never hunted another bear again.
