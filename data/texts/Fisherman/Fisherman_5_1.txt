One day an old Maine man was fishing on a lake. He wasn't having any luck catching fish. After a while he gave up and went back to his fishing shack. When he arrived, the door was wide open. The man was of a suspicious nature, so he crept inside quietly, and saw a huge bear tearing off the cork to a molasses bottle with his teeth. The man screamed, which startled the bear and made him spill molasses on his paw. The bear ran outside, and soon all of the insects around were swarming around the sweet sticky paw. The bear waded into the lake to get rid of them. Suddenly a large trout jumped out of the water, and the bear hit it with his paw onto the shore. The man watched from the woods as the bear cuffed every trout that jumped out of the water to the bank. Soon the bear had a nice pile of fish. The old man watched the bear eat half a dozen trout, his stomach rumbling. He only had a stale piece of bread for dinner. Then, he noticed the bear lining up the remaining fish and leaving. The man crept down to the bank to look, and sure enough, the bear had left him 6 large trout. He looked up to see the bear standing in the woods with his now clean paw.
