There was a fisherman fishing on his favorite lake in Maine. He was not having very much luck catching any fish. He eventually gave up and walked back to his fishing hut. When he got closer he noticed that the door was open. When he looked in the door he saw a big black bear. The bear knocked a jar of molasses down and spread his big black paw through it on the ground. The man screamed loudly and startled the bear who then ran down to the water. When he reached the water, he put his sticky paw full of molasses in the air and many bugs, flies, and mosquitoes became caught in the sticky goop. He then put his paw on top of the water. All of a sudden a giant fish jumped out towards the bugs on the paw and the bear swatted it towards the beach. He put his paw towards the surface of the water again and another big fish jumped out, which he swatted towards the sandy beach. This happened again and again until the bear had a dozen fish on the beach. He then walked towards his pile and began to eat them. The fisherman had walked towards the beach and hid behind a bush. His stomach was grumbling because he was so hungry. Suddenly the bear noticed him hiding in the bushes. He looked at him and then at his pile of fish. Then he put the remaining fish in a line and started walking away down the beach and towards the forest. The fisherman went to the pile of fish and noticed that the bear had left him half a dozen! He looked up towards the bear who was looking at him from the opening into the forest. He held up his now clean paw and waved. The fisherman waved back. He vowed to himself that he would never hunt a big black bear again.
