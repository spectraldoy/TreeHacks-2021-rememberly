There was a fine old man fishing at his favorite lake with little luck to show for it. After a while he decided enough was enough and walked down the shore to his cabin. Upon approaching the cabin the man heard a strange noise. Being of a cautious nature, the man peered around the corner and was amazed by what he saw. There was a big black bear standing in his cabin, with his paw deep in a jar of molasses. The jar fell off the paw and rolled on the floor. The mad let out a shout, startling the bear causing it to run out of the cabin and down to the lake. Standing on its hind legs, the bear walked into the water holding his sticky sweet paw in the air. Soon the flies, mosquitoes, and other bugs came looking for that sticky sweet nectar and got stuck in the bears paw. Once the bear was deep in the lake with only his sticky paw up in the air, suddenly a trout came jumping out of the water trying to eat the bugs. The bear gave it a quick swat and knocked it to shore. Then another, and another trout came jumping for the bugs, each cuffed to shore. Soon enough, the bear had quite the feast.
