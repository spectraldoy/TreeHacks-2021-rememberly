Once there was a fisherman catching fish along the lake shore. The man caught nothing. As he was heading back to his fishing shed, he saw the door was open. Being the suspicious man that he was, he peered inside to see what was there. To his surprise, a big black bear was in his fishing shed.



The bear found the man's molasses. He unscrewed the cork with his teeth and then spilled molasses everywhere. He wiped the floor with his paw, causing his paw to become sticky. When the man saw this, he screamed, and the bear was so startled that he started to run toward the lake shore. On his hind legs, he kept his paw in the air. Soon enough, flies started to swarm his paw to get to the sweet and sticky molasses. 



As flies swarmed his hand, fish tried to come up out of the water to eat the flies. Every time a fish would jump up, the bear would swat it away, making a pile of fish he had cuffed on the lakeshore. The man watched from the bushes in awe as the bear was eating half a dozen trout. His stomach rumbled, as he had nothing to eat for dinner except bread and some of that molasses. 



The bear looked over in the bushes at the man. Then, he left fish in a pile. The man walked over and sure enough, the bear had laid out 6 large trout in a line for him to eat. He looked over at the bear, who had gone to the other side of the shore. He thanked the bear, and the bear motioned over to him before running off. The man looked at the trout, and said, "Wow. This is the first time a bear has ever paid me for molasses." He decided he would never hunt bears again.
