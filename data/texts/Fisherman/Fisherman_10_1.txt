One fine day an old man was down by the lake fishing for trout.  However, he was having no luck catching any.  He returned to his fishing shack and saw that the door was open.  Being a cautious old me he approached the shack slowly and peered through the door.  Inside he saw a black bear holding a barrel of molasses.  The bear was pulling the cork out of the barrel and the molasses was pouring onto the floor.  The bear then rubbed his paws in the molasses.  The old man yelled at the bear to get out and the bear was so startled it ran straight towards the lake shore. The old man had followed the bear and hid in a bush watching the bear.  The bear stood up on two hind legs in the lake and held out his paw over the water where it attracted flies.  Soon trout were jumping out of the water trying to catch the flies and each time the trout jumped out of the water the bear swatted the trout onto the shore.  The bear then began to eat the trout.  The old mans stomach was rumbling watching the bear eat the trout.  All he had left at home to eat was some bread and the leftover molasses.  The bear looked over at the bush the old man was hiding in and then walked away from his trout.  The old man walked over to where the bear had been eating the trout and noticed that the bear had left him 6 trout.  He yelled "Thank you!" to the bear who waved his now clean paw and went off into the woods.  The man remarked to himself "well this is the first time I've had a bear pay for my molasses".
