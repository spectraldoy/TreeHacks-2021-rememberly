There was a fisherman who loved to fish on a lake in Maine. He was not catching anything when he saw something suspicious going on in his house. He opens the door and sees a bear holding a jar of honey. When the bear sees him he drops the jar and smears honey all over his paws. The bear then goes outside and waves his paws in the air and bugs get caught in them. The bear goes to the river and puts his paw near the water and a trout jumps in to eat the bugs. The bear then cuffs lots of fish to the side of the river. The man is watching from behind a bush. The bear gets out of the river and eats the fish but leaves 6 large trout for the fisherman. The bear then leaves and waves goodbye. The fisherman gladly takes the fish and says he will never hunt bears again.
