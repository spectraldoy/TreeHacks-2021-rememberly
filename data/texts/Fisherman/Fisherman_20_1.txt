There was an old fisherman that wasn't having much luck catching fish one day. He eventually became discouraged and headed home. He saw that his door was already opened and to his surprise found a black bear inside eating his molasses. The man was startled. The black bear had spilled molasses all on the floor and was rubbing his paw in it. The bear eventually walked outside with the sticky paw and headed to the shore line. He attracted many flies and bugs with his sticky paw. He went into the water and held his paw just above the waterline with the flies and bugs still attracted to his paw. The bugs attracted one big trout after the other which the bear swatted out of the air and into a pile on shore. He then went to his pile and ate half a dozen while the old fisherman watched from the bushes. The bear noticed the hungry fisherman and laid aside a row of fish to share. The fisherman thanked the bear and joked " this is the first time I've had a bear repay me for my molasses". The fisherman never hunted bear again.
