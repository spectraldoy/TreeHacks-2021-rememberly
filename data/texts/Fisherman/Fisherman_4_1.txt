Once there was an old Maine man. The Main man was fishing and could not catch anything. He was hungry. He came back to his house to find a bear in his molasses. The bear dropped the molasses, causing a spill on the floor, and he wiped his paw in the molasses on the floor making a large sticky mess. Seeing the bear, the man was extremely startled and he screamed. Then, the bear was startled by his scream and ran away with his sticky paw. When he got to the river, he splashed in the water with his sticky paw covered in molasses. There were a lot of flies surrounding him because they sensed the molasses. The fish from the water jumped up to catch the flies. Every time a fish jumped to get the flies, the bear swatted it away. Soon enough it had a pile of fish to eat. The man watched in awe as the bear had a dozen fish to eat, whereas he had nothing. He was so hungry and his stomach was rumbling, as he had only eaten some bread with the leftover molasses for dinner. The bear looked at the man and left fish behind for him. The man looked over, and sure enough, there were 6 large trout left in a row for him to eat. The man thought, wow, this is the first time a bear has ever thanked me for some molasses. He vowed to never hunt bear again.
