One day old Maine walked came back from fishing, having caught very little. Just as he walked into the fishing shack, he saw a bear using his teeth to open a molasses jar.  The bear was startled and ran out of the shack with a paw full of molasses.

	The fisherman walked out of the shack to watch the bear. The bear raised his hand full of molasses and attracted a bunch of bugs and flies, so he put his hand in the water. The bug and flies attracted trout.  So every time the bear's paw was in the air, he swatted the trout away and flung them onto the shore. The bear repeated this so that he had many fish.

	Old Main watched the bear from the shore.  Having caught very little that day, his stomach was rumbling as he watched the bear catch fish.  The only thing the fisherman had to eat was some bread and what was left of his molasses.

	Sure enough, the bear came up to him and gave him 6 trout fish to eat.  This was the first time a bear had paid him back for his molasses.
