One fine day a man was out fishing for trout and he was not having any luck.  He packed up his gear and walked along the shore back to his fishing shack.  When he neared the shack he noticed that the door was open.  Because he was a careful man he looked into the doorway and saw a black bear trying to open a crock of molasses.  The bear was pouring the molasses onto the floor and rubbing his paws in it.  The man yelled at the bear and the bear was so startled the he jumped up and ran out the door towards the shore.  He walked into the water on two legs and held out his molasses covered paw over the water.  The man followed the bear and hid in a bush to watch the bear.  The bear's paw was attracting flies and soon a trout jumped out of the water to eat the fly.  The bear slapped the trout onto the shore and continued in this way until he had a pile of trout.  He started eating the trout.  He looked up and noticed the man in the bush.  The bear started to arrange the leftover trout in a row.  The man felt hungry and knew that there was only the leftover molassess for dinner back at his fishing shack.  The bear walked away th the edge of the woods.  The man had a hunch and walked over to the pile of fish the bear had left him.  The old man thanked the bear and the bear walked off into the woods.  The old man exclaimed "That's the first time I've ever had a bear pay me for my molasses!" And he never hunted bear again.
