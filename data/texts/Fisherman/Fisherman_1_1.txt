There was once an old man fishing on a lake. He was catching very little. He went back to his house and saw a bear in his kitchen. The bear had his paw in a jar of molasses. He was fanning his paw and a swarm of bugs appeared. The bear then went back to the river. He waved his paw over the water and a trout appeared. He threw it to the side of the river. The old man watched from behind the bushes. The bear continued to catch trout. He cuffed every one to the side of the river. The bear saw the old man hiding. The bear ate and then laid six trout in a line. The old mans stomach was rumbling. All he had for dinner was a bread and leftover molasses. The old man says thank you to the bear. The bear waves his now clean paw back to the man. This is the last time I hunt bear he thought.
