One day a fisherman was out at sea attempting to catch some fish. He was having no luck so decided to go home. When he headed home, he noticed his front door was open. So he looked inside and saw a big black bear. It had it's paws on his jar of molasses. The bear dropped the jar and used his paw to scoop a big glob of molasses.

The fisherman screamed and the bear was startled and ran outside. When it got onto the shore, flies and insects were attracted to its paw because of the sweet, sticky scent of the molasses. So, the bear ran into the water to avoid them. In the water, one fish jumped out of the water and tried to get at the bear's paw. So, the bear swiped at it, pushing it onto land, and killed it. This happened for several more fish.

Soon, the bear had a good sized pile of dead fish. So, while the fisherman looked on from the shadows, the bear began to eat the fish. Before it finished, however, it looked at the fisherman and rearranged the remaining fish into a straight line, and went up the shore. The fisherman came close to the fish and remarked how he had never been had a bear pay him for eating his molasses. 

The bear saw the fisherman with the fish, waved a paw at him, then retreated.
