One day a fisherman was out on his lake, but he hadn't caught anything all day. Eventually, he decided to give in and return to his shack up the shore. As he approached his house, he noticed that the door was ajar. Being of a suspicious nature, he peered into the house, only to see a bear, holding his jar of marmalade in one paw and taking the top off with the other. The man watched as the bear dumped the marmalade on the ground and covered his paw in the gooey substance. The man screamed and ran from the house, hiding in a nearby bush. Shocked at the sound of the scream, the bear also ran out to the shore of the lake. The bear raised his marmalade-covered paw high in the air, soon becoming covered in mosquitoes, flies, and other bugs attracted to the sticky-sweet substance. Then, he waded into the lake, holding the bug and marmalade-covered paw over the water. Suddenly, a fish jumped out of the water in the direction of the paw.
