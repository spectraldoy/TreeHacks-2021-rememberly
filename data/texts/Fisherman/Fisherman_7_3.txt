A man was fishing and didn't catch anything so he left the lake. When he arrived back at his cabin, he was shocked to see his door left open. He was a curious man so he went to see what was inside and saw a bear eating his jar of nectar where he took the cork off with his teeth. The bear was startled when he saw the man, so he dropped the nectar everywhere and ran from the cabin. The bear arrived at the lake and a large number of bugs were attracted to the nectar on his hands. He kept catching flies, bees, and a large number of bugs because they loved the nectar. When the bear went in the water, the fish kept jumping out of the water and the bear would swat them on shore. When he got out of the water the bear had so many fish and started eating them. The man was in the bushes watching the bear and was jealous because all he had to eat was a piece of bread. The bear looked over and saw the man, and then he lined up half a dozen fish and walked away. The man realized the bear left the fish for him and was extremely grateful. He vowed never to shoot bears again and this was the first time a bear had ever paid him for nectar.
