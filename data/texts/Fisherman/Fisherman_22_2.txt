The old Maine man was fishing on the lake but wasn't catching anything. He returned to his cabin and found the door to be open. He was suspicious so he looked inside and saw a large bear pulling the cork from his molasses jug using his teeth. The old man screamed, startling the bear, and the bear ran from his house to the shore of the lake with his sticky paw. His sticky sweet paw attracted all of the flies and mosquitoes and bugs. When he entered the water he held his sticky paw above and trout began to jump out of the water to eat the bugs. The bear hit the trout onto the shore until he ended up with a large pile of fish. The fisherman watched this unfold and noted how he was unable to catch any fish today himself. The bear returned to the shore with his paw clean and ate the fish. The bear then saw the old man watching him feast from the bushes and left the four remaining fish in a row on the shore. As the bear headed to the woods the old man thanked him for the fish and he waved. The old man noted he had never been paid for his molasses by a bear before. He took gathered the remaining 4 fish and went home.
