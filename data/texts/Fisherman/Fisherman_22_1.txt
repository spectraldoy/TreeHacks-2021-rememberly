The old Maine man was fishing and he wasn't catching very many fish. He went back to his cabin and had a suspicious feeling. He looked into the window and spotted a bear pulling the cork from his molasses by his teeth. This startled the old man and he screamed. His scream frightened the bear. The bear ran towards the shore of the lake with his paw full of molasses. The flies and other bugs were attracted to his sticky paw. The bear entered the water while holding his paw full of bugs up in the air. Trout began to jump out of the water to eat the flies at the bears' paws. The bear quickly swatted at the trout and hit it onto the shore of the lake. Trout continued to jump at his paw, one swiftly after another, and the bear hit them onto the shore as well. The old man watched from the bushes. After the bear cleaned the molasses from his paw he went back to shore and lined up the trout.
