One fine day an old Maine man was fishing on his favorite lake, catching very little. Finally, he gave up and walked along the shore back to his fishing shack. When he got close to the front door, he saw it was open. Being of a suspicious nature, he quietly went up to the door and looked inside. There was a big black bear. He had just pulled the cork out of his molasses jug with his teeth. The molasses spilled all over the floor, the bear smearing his paw in it.

When the old man saw the bear he scream out loud, startling the bear and causing it to run out to the lake shore. Soon, all the flies and bugs and mosquitoes swarmed around the bear's sticky sweet paw. The bear stood on its hind legs and waded into the lake, holding its paw over the water. Suddenly, a big trout jumped out of the water trying to get at the bugs. The bear swatted at the fish and it flew to the shore and flopped there.
