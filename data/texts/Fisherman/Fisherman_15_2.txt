One fine day, an old Maine man went to his fishing shack after a long day of fishing and catching nothing. He found the door open. Being of a suspicious nature, he quietly peeked around the corner. A big black bear was foraging in his house, with his tooth stuck in the molasses jug. He screamed, which caused the bear to startle and run to the lake shore, spilling the molasses.



He held his paw full of molasses in the air. The sticky paw attracted a big trout. He flung the trout all the way to the shore. His sticky paw continued to attract fish, with its flies, bugs, and worms. Soon, the bear had a small pile of fish on the surface.



He had eaten at least half a dozen, while the old man watched from the bushes. He had only had bread and what was left of the molasses for dinner. Seeing him, the bear lined up the remaining fish in a row.



The old man said, "Thank you", to the bear, and he returned a sticky paw. He vowed never to hunt bear again.
