A man was fishing at a cabin but was catching very little. When he got off his boat and back to the cabin, he saw a bear pulling the lid off of a jar of molasses with his teeth. The man screamed and the bear was startled and spilled the molasses all over the floor. Because the bear's paws were covered in molasses, he started attracting flies and mosquitoes.  They were everywhere and he could not get rid of them. Finally, the bear started catching trout with his sticky paws. The man was upset because the bear caught way more trout with the molasses than he ever could. The bear then started flinging the trout on the ground and eating them. After a while, the bear looked over and saw the man hiding in the bushes. He left six trout out in a line for the man when he was finished eating and walked away. The man was so grateful for the trout and thanked the bear and vowed never to hunt bears again because they brought him trout.
