One day and old Maine man went fishing on a lake and caught very little. Discouraged he walked back to his fishing shack, and being of a curious nature he looked inside. When he looked inside he saw a big black bear holding his jar of molasses with the cork in his mouth. The bear pulled out the cork and the molasses splilled on the ground going everywhere. The bear rubbed his paw in the molasses. When the old man saw the bear he let out a scream which startled the bear and sent him running to the river bank. Standing on his hind legs the molasses began to attract all types of bugs and mosquitos. The bear waded into the water and soon a large trout jumped up at him trying to get the bugs. The bear swatted the trout and it flopped on the shore. This happened again and again and each time the bear swatted the trout onto the shore until he had a large pile. The old man was watcheing the bear from the bushes and saw him eat half a dozen trout. The old man started to think about how hungry he was.
