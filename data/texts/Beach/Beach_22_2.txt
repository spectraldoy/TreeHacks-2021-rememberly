It was a hot and sunny summer day so Kaylie and Rachael decided to head to the beach to enjoy it and relax. On the way to the beach, the sun was shining golden yellow pellets of rays. After arriving at the beach and walking through the parking lot they came upon the beautiful sand and crystal clear water that faded into blue. The beach was swarming with people both in the water and on shore. There were people relaxing on yellow, orange and pink towels in the sand and others lounging in beach chairs with broad-brimmed hats covering their eyes from the sun. Children were making sand castles decorated with smooth seashells. 



Kaylie decided to spread out her towel and rest in the sun. Rachael decided to head down to the water to cool off first. On her way to the water a little girl with freckles and yellow floaties darted in front of her closely followed by a little boy in green swimming shorts. This reminded Kaylie of beach days as a child with her brothers. She thought the water. She looked back up towards the sand and noticed a group of teenagers flying colorful paragliders. She thought the day was beautiful, perfect, and a relaxing break from the anxieties of her daily life. She then headed back up to the sand to relax and join her friend Rachael.
