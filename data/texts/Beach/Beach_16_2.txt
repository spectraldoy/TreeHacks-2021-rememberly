One day, Kaylie and Rachel decided to visit Old Orchard Beach in Maine to take advantage of their day off. The sun was an optimistic yellow pellet, and the water glistened like crystals before fading into a dark blue on the horizon, when they arrived at the parking lot. Some people were on yellow, pink, white, or orange towels, while others were stretched out on lounge chairs wearing wide-brimmed hats to shield their eyes from the sun. Children were decorating sandcastles with smooth seashells.



After reaching the beach, Rachel decided to cool off in the water while Kaylie took a nap on the sand. After heading into the surf, Rachel watch a young girl in a light purple bathing suit with small yellow floaties go darting past her, followed by a boy in a green swimsuit. Rachel smiled as she reminisced about beach days past with her brothers. Rachel watched four teenagers flying colorful paragliders above her, and determined that this was truly a perfect day, as her anxieties of life faded away for a while. Rachel then returned to the shore to join Kaylie to lie down on the warm sand.
