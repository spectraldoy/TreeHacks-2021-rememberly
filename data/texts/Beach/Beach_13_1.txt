It was a nice sunny day and kaylie headed towards the pool at the beach to sunbathe with her friends.  Lisa and Rachel were meeting her there, and Rachel greeted her as she had already arrived .



They were  quite happy at this their carefree day at the beach.  They had decided to meet there, as I told Lisa, "because it's totally a sturday.."

S   o this cute boy , according to Rachel walks over,.. I notice the confidant exuding stride.  And after looking over, he continues to put his mat down and like Ryan I said to my friend Lisa, the cute boy  had st down to join  our party at the beach.
