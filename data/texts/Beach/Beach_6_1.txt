On a warm sunny day Kaylie and Rachel decided to enjoy their day off at the beach. As they arrived at the beach they could see the white sand where it meets the crystal clear water that fades into dark blue.  They see a yellow sun .As they walk up to the beach they see people with yellow, orange, and white beach towels laying out while others had chairs and board hats that covered their eyes from the sun's rays.  We see little kids making sand castled with smoothed edged shells in the sand. Rachel decided to lay out her beach towel to take a nap, while I decided to take a dip in the ocean to cool off. As I was walking, a little girl in a purple swimsuit with yellow floaties ran by me as her brother followed shortly after her. I closed my eyes and smile as it reminded my of my brother and I at the beach. I thought to myself, today is the perfect day.
