Kaylee and Rachel decided to take a trip to the beach in Maine. The sun was like a yellow bullet piercing into the day. People at the beach were using white, yellow, orange, and pink towels and it was a crowded day. Kaylee decided to take a nap while Rachel decided to explore the beach. 



The sun shone onto the water, making it shine like a thousand crystals. There was a little girl with freckles in a purple suit that was running into the water. Quickly, a boy followed her. It reminded her of the times when her and her brother used to come to the beach as kids. Suddenly, all of her anxieties melted away. She closed her eyes to savor the moment before laying down to join Kaylee.
