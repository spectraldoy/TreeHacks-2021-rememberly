Rachel and Morgan had a day off from school. They decided to use that day to go to the beach. They put on sunscreen and drove the 1 hour to the Maine beach. When they got there, they noticed that people were laid out in yellow, orange, pink, and white towels. The ocean blended into the sky and the sun was glistening over it. It was a crowded day. Morgan laid out her beach towel and decided to take a nap while Rachel decided to cool off in the water.

As she approached the water, a little girl in a purple bathing suit ran by her followed by a little boy. This reminded Rachel of when she was a child and her brother would run after her at the beach. She looked back at her to see teenage boys playing with kites. She smiled and realized today was the absolute perfect day and the stress melted off of her. She went back to where Morgan was and laid down her beach towel to join her.
