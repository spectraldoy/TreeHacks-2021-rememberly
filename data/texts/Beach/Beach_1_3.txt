Two girls ones named Rachel had a day off work so they decided to go down to the beach in Maine. The sun was blistering yellow ball in the sky. They get to the beach and the water is sparkling. 

They decided to lay out and get some sun. There were people all around and many where laying out with large sun hats. Eventually Rachel decides to go down to the water to cool off. She sees a little boy chasing a little girl around with yellow floaties in a purple bathing suit. It reminds her of when she was younger and used to play with her brother. After cooling off she goes back to lay out with her friend. Rachel comments on how beautiful the day is and is purely relaxed for the first time in a while.
