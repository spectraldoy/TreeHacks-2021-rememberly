It was a hot sunny day and Kaylie and Rachel decided to take advantage and head out to the beach. The sun was a bright orange ball in the sky. As they came up to the beach, they grabbed their towels and decided to lay out for a while. The clear blue water looked like a million crystals glistening in the sun. The beach was full of boys and girls playing in the water and many other people laying out on the sand. Kaylie put her towel down and sat on top of it. Soon a boy wearing blue shorts ran by her followed by a girl wearing a green bathing suit. Rachel sat back and remembered how she used to spend the summer's with her brothers on the beach passing the time. As she thought back to those memories, she relished the fact that she could relax and not think about work, but just enjoy her time anxiety free.
