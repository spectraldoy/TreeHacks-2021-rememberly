It was a hot, sunny day when Kaylie and Rachel decided to take advantage of their day off and go to the beach. The yellow pellet of sun was shining so optimistically on the beach as the two arrived. They walked in from the parking lot with their beach towels in hand. The beach was swarming with people on colorful towels of orange, yellow and red. The children used seashells to decorate their sand castles while adults wore sun hats to protect from burning. Kaylie decided to lay out her towel and lay down to take a nap while Rachel went to cool off in the ocean. 



She started walking towards the shore when she saw a young girl in a light purple bathing suit with bright yellow floaties on her arms. The girl darted in front of her as a young boy in green swim trunks chased after her. Rachel smiled and reminisced about her own childhood, playing with her brothers. She then looked to see four teenage boys using colorful paragliders. She reminisced more and headed back up to the towel.
