It was a hot sunny day and Rachel and Kaylie decided to take advantage of their day off and take a trip to the beach. The sun was an optimistic yellow and it blistered in the sky as they made their way to Old Orchard Beach in Maine. The beach was filled with lots of people. Some were spread out on beach towers, others were on lounge chairs, and others had on wide-brimmed hats as they shielded themselves from the sun. Children were decorating sandcastles with smooth, round seashells and Kaylie decided to spread out on her towel and take a quick nap while Rachel went to go cool off in the ocean. 



	The sun shined on the water and made it look like a million little crystals. Just before making it to the surf, Rachel saw a little girl with freckles and a light purple bathing suit and little yellow floaties on her arms. She darted in front of Rachel and was closely followed by a boy in green swim trunks. Rachel smiled as thought about her own beach days with her brothers. After spending some time in the water, Rachel got up and saw 4 teens flying with colorful paragliders. She thought to herself just how perfect of a day she'd had, free from all the worries of her daily life. She savored the moment a bit more by closing her eyes, then went to go join Kaylie in the warm sand.
