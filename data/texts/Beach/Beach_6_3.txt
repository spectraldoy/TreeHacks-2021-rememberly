It was a warm, sunny days so my friend and I decided to go to the beach. As we drove, the sun looked like a bright yellow ball in the sky. When we arrived at the beach the parking lot was full and I could see the where the blue sky met the white sand. We walked towards the beach and it was crowded or people, laying out, playing, and swimming, My friend decided she want the lay down her beach towel and take a nap. I decided to walk to the ocean and cool off. As I was walking, a little girl in a yellow and purple swimsuit ran in front of me, followed by her little brother. It reminded me of my little brother and I at the beach years ago. I looked out into the ocean and say a couple of teen boys parasailing in the distance.  I walked back to my friend, laid out my towel, and started to take a nap. I thought to myself, today is the perfect day.
