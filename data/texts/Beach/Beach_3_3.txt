On their day off from work Kaylie and Rachel decided to go to the beach. The sun was an optimistic yellow pellet in the sky as they drove. They emerged from the parking lot and saw that the beach was crowded with people, some running around, others lying on pink, white, yellow and orange blankets. Kaylie decided to lay on her towel in the sand nap. Rachel decided to go to the water to cool off before joining her. As she walked towards the ocean, she saw the water was reflecting like thousands of tiny crystals. A little girl in a purple bathing suit ran by her, and a boy in green swim trunks followed. Rachel smiled, remembering beach days with her own brothers. As she walked into the water, she saw four teenagers flying colorful kites. She thought this was truly a perfect day. She savored the moment for a few a seconds, then walked back over to Kaylie and laid in the sand beside her.
