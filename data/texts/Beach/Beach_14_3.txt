Two girls decided to go to Old Orchard Beach on their day off from work, so they packed up their car and drove out on the road. The sun was a like blistering, yellow pellet in the sky and burned down on them as they drove. When they parked by the beach, they saw a lot of people had already gathered there. There were kids building sand castles with sea shells, people leaning back in lounge chairs with wide-brimmed sunhats shielding their faces, and others laying down in the sand on pink, white, orange, and yellow towels. One of the girls laid down on the sand to nap, while the other went down to the water to cool off. 

	The girl in the water felt peaceful as she looked out across the water that sparkled like a million tiny crystals. Overhead, four teenagers were hang-gliding through the air, and she. She watched a girl in a yellow swimsuit and purple floaties run past her, followed by a boy in green swimming shorts. The sight made her nostalgic as she remembered going to the beach and playing with her brothers. After a hwile, she returned to lay down next to her friend on sand.
