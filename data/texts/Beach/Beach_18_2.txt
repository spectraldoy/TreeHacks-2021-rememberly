It was a hot and sunny day and Kaylie and Rachel decided to take advantage of their day off and take a trip to the beach. The sun was a yellow optimistic pellet in the sky as they drove to Old Orchard Beach in Maine. As they approached the beach, they saw the crystal water that faded into deep blue on the horizon. The beach was swarmed with people. People were on yellow, orange, white, and pink towels, while others were stretched out on lounge chairs wearing wide brimmed hats shading their eyes from the suns rays. Children were decorating sand castles with smooth shells. Kaylie decided to take a quick nap while Rachel went to the ocean to cool off. 

	As Rachel reached the surf of the crystal waters, a little girl in a purple bathing suit with freckles and yellow floaties darted in front of her followed by a little boy in green swim shorts. She smiled as she reminisced about beach days with her brothers. While she was in the water, she watched four teenagers fly beautiful paragliders. She felt like the day was perfect. She closer her eyes for a few moments to savor the experience as she felt her anxieties slip away. She got up and joined Kaylie on the sand.
