It was a hot, sunny day when Kaylie and Rachel decided to take advantage of their off day and take a trip to the beach. The sun was a blistering, yellow pellet in the sky as the girls drove to Old Orchard Beach in Maine. The girls saw the crystal clear water turn to deep blue at the horizon as they from the parking lot. The beach was swarming with people. Some people were laying on yellow, orange, white, and pink towels while others could be seen stretching out on chairs. Kaylie decided to lay her towel day in the sand and take a quick nap while Rachel decided to cool off by taking a dip in the ocean.

	The sun bounced off the water making it look like a million, tiny crystals. Just as Rachel got to the water, a girl with freckles in a purple swimming suit and yellow floaties ran in front of her. Her brother, wearing green swim trunks, chased her into the waves. She reminisced on the her childhood days of playing with her brothers at the beach. As she was leaving the water, she saw four teenagers flying colorful paragliders. All of her daily anxieties disappeared for this day. She decided the moment was perfect and closed her eyes to savor the moment before walking up the beach to lay next to Kaylie in the warm sand.
