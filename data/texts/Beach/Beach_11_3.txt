Jennifer and Denise had a day off from work and were excited to go to the beach. As they entered the parking lot they could see the crystal blue water glimmering in the distance. They got out of there car and approached the sand. The beach was full of people laying on the sand and playing in the water. Jennifer decided to walk down to the water and Denise laid out on her towel. The sun was a beautiful  orange pellet hanging in the sky. As Jennifer stood by the water a girl wearing a yellow bathing suit ran past her followed by a boy wearing blue swim shorts. Denise laid on her blanket without a care in the world and thought about what a perfect day this was.
