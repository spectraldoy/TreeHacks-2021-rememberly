Two girl friends had a day off of work so they decided to take a trip and spend it at the beach! The sun was a bright shining yellow ball in the sky when they took off for the beach. They drove for an hour and then finally made it. When they were walking out of the parking lot, they saw the crystal blue water shining up at them. 

When they made it to the beach, they saw that it was full of sunbathers with yellow, orange, and pink towels. One girl decided to lay down her towel and take a quick nap in the warm sand. The other girl decided to take a dip in the water. 

She walked towards the water that was reflecting the light back like a million little crystals. She was about to step into the water when two little children, one boy in purple swim trunks and one girl, ran right past her. She smiled and reminisced on the days that she spent at the beach with her brothers. She waded out into the water and spent a few minutes reflecting. She saw a group of teenagers flying rainbow kites in the sky. She thought, "this really is the perfect day". It allowed them to get away from all of the normal stressors and daily hassles of life. 

She then walked back towards the other girl and laid her towel next to her on the warm sand.
