It was a warm, sunny day and Kaylee and Rachel decided to use their day off to go to the beach. The sun was an optimistic yellow pellet shining on the day. They arrived at Old Orchard Beach in Maine. Rachel looked as the water turned from a crystal clear light blue to a darker blue further away. The beach was swarming with people, some on yellow, orange, pink, and white beach towels. Kaylee laid out her towel and decided to take a nap while Rachel decided to cool off in the ocean.



As Rachel was making her way to the reef, she saw a girl in a light purple bathing suit with freckles running toward the beach. The girl passed by her followed by a young boy. It reminded her of the times she had at the beach with her brother. She then looked behind her to see four teenagers playing with kites. She decided that this day was absolutely perfect, and all of her worries melted away for a moment. She closed her eyes to take advantage of the feeling. She then decided to join Kaylee laying on the warm sand.
