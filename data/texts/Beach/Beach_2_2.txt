It was a hot, sunny day and Kaylie and Rachel decided to take advantage of their off day and take a trip to the beach. The sun was an optimistic, yellow pellet blistering in the sky as they were making their way to Old Orchard Beach in Maine. As the girls were walking from the lot to the beach, they saw the crystal clear water fading into a deep blue on the horizon. The beach was swarming with people. Some were laying orange, yellow, white, and pink towels, while others could be seen stretched out on lounge chairs with broad-brimmed hats shading their eyes from the rays of the sun. There were children decorating sand castles with round sea shells as Rachel decided to spread her towel on the sand and take a quick nap and Kaylie decided to cool off in the water.

	The light shone on the water, causing it to look like a million crystals. Just before Rachel reached the surf, a little freckled girl with a light purple bathing suit with small yellow floaties darted in front of her closely followed by a little boy in green swimming shorts. Rachel smiled reminiscing on beach days with her brothers. After cooling off in the water for a while, Rachel looked up to see four teenagers flying colorful paragliders. Rachel decided the day was truly perfect, and all the anxieties from her daily life were gone. She closed her eyes and savored the moment before going back to lay next to Kaylie in the warm sand.
