It was a hot, sunny day and Kaylie and Rachel decided to take advantage of their day off and take a trip to the beach. The sun was an optimistic pellet of yellow, blistering in the sky during their road trip.  Once arriving and walking through the parking lot, they could just see the clear water fading into the deep blue of the horizon.  The beach was swarming with people.  Some with orange, yellow, white, and pink beach towels, while others were sprawled out on lounge chairs with large hats brimming over their heads to protect theirs eyes. The kids were decorating sandcastles with smooth, round seashells.  Kaylie decided to stretch out on her towel and take a nap, while Rachel decided to go to the ocean to cool off. 

The sun shined on the water, causing it to look like a thousand little crystals. Before Rachel made it to the surf, she saw a little girl with freckles in a purple bathing suit and yellow floaties on her arms.  The girl darted infront of Rachel, quickly followed by a boy in a green bathing suit.  Rachel smiled and reminisced on going to the beach with her brother.  After being in the ocean for awhile, Rachel looked up and saw four teenagers flying paragliders.  Rachel was so happy and thought about how perfect this day was and how all the anxiety from her life was gone.  She then went back up to join Kaylie on the warm sand.
