It was a hot, sunny day and Rachel and her friend Kaylie decided it would be a good day to go to the beach.  They headed out to Old Orchard beach in Maine.  The sun looked like a hot, yellow pellet in the sky.   There were people laying under beach umbrellas wearing wide brimmed hats. Rachael decided that she would like to lay down in the sun before going swimming.  Kaylie dedcided to go for a swim.  A little girl in a light purple bathing suit with two floaties darted out in front of her followed closely by a boy in green shorts.  Kaylie smiled to herself remembering long past beach days with her brothers.  She saw 4 teenagers flying paragliders.  She thought about this as she walked over to lay down next to Rachel, thinking about what a perfect day this was turning out to be.
