It was a hot, sunny day, and Kaylie and Rachel decided to take advantage of their day off to take a trip to the beach. The sun was a yellow pellet overlooking the sky, and the water darkened from a light blue at shore to dark blue at the horizon. As they approached the beach, they saw that it was packed with people enjoying the day. People were laying on orange, yellow, pink, and white towels,  and children decorated sand-castles using smooth seashells. 



Kaylie decided to lie on her towel and take a short nap, while Rachel went into the water to cool off. A small red-haired girl in a purple swimsuit darted past her legs, followed by a little boy in a green swimsuit. She smiled and reminisced about days at the beach with her brothers. She looked back and saw several teenagers lounging on the beach as well. This simply felt like the perfect dayâ€”all of her anxieties were on hold for a while. Rachel exited the water and sat down next to Kaylie.
