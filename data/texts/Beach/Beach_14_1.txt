It was a hot, sunny day, and Kaylie and Rachel decided to make the most of their day off and go to the beach. The sun was a bright yellow pellet, blistering in the sky as they drove to Old Orchard beach in Maine. The were a lot of people there. Some stretched out on yellow, orange, pink, and white towels, while others lounged in chairs with big-brimmed hats, watching their children play. Kaylie quickly laid down in the sand for a nap, stretched out over her towel, while Rachel headed to the water to cool off. 

As Rachel looked out onto the water, it shined like a million crystals in the sun. She spotted a young girl in a light purple swimsuit with yellow arm floaties. A boy in green swimming shorts darted in front of her, causing Rachel to reminisce about going to the beach with her brothers. She had many good memories of going to the beach. Rachel eventually left the water  laid back down next to Kaylie.
