Because they had the day off work, Rachel and Sara decided to take a trip to the beach. It was the perfect day; the sun was shining and, as they drove into the parking lot, they could see that the beach was crowded. There were children making sandcastles and adults wearing wide-brimmed beach hats lounging on every color of towel you could imagine. As they approached the blue-green water, Sara decided to take a nap on her towel, while Rachel got in the water. Rachel walked across the sand and waist-deep into the water, admiring the darkening of the ocean as it approached the horizon. A little girl in a purple suit toddled past her, followed by a boy in green swimming trunks and floaties. Smiling at them, Rachel recalled trips to the beach as a kid with her older brothers. She looked off into the distance at several teenagers on Jetskis, and decided to go back to her towel to rest.
