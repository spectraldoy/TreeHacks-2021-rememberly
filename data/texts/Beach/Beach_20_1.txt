One sunny day kaylie and Rachel decided to take a trip to the Orchard beach in Maine on their day off. The sun was a blistering, big, yellow pellet in the sky. They parked and looked out at the water that looked like thousands of shining crystals and faded into deep blue. They saw the beach was swarmed with people. They saw people on yellow, orange, and pink towels and children decorating smooth sandcastles with seashells. Kaylie decided to stay on the beach while Rachel headed for the water. A little girl in a purple swimsuit with yellow floaties was being chased by a boy in green swim trunks. They passed in front of Rachel. It reminded her of going to the beach with her brothers. All of the day's anxieties melted away.
