It was a hot, sunny day and Kaylie and Rachel decided to take advantage of their off day by taking a trip to the beach. The sun was an optimistic yellow pellet as they drove to Old Orchard Beach in Maine. Once they parked and walked toward the beach, they saw the crystal clear waters that faded into a deep blue on the horizon. The beach was swarming with people. Some stretched out on yellow, orange, white and pink towels in the sand, while other could be seen on lounge chairs with broad brimmed hats shading their eyes from the rays of the sun. Children were decorating sandcastles with smooth, round seashells, and Kaylie decided to stretch out on her towel in the sand for a quick nap while Rachel went to cool off in the ocean. 

The sun sparkled off the water, causing it to look like a million little crystals. Just before making it to the surf, Rachel saw a little girl with freckles in a light purple bathing suit with yellow floaties on her arms. She darted in front of Rachel, closely followed by a boy in green swimming shorts. Rachel smiled, reminiscing on days at the beach with her brothers. After spending some time in the water, Rachel looked up and saw four teenagers sailing paragliders. She thought that this was truly the perfect place to be, and all the worries from her daily anxieties faded away. She closed her eyes to savor the moment before going back to lie with Kaylie on the warm sand.
