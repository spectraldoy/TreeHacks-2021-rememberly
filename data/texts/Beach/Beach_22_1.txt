Kaylie and Rachael both had a day off and decided to go to the beach since it was a nice summer day. They drove to Old Orchard Beach in Maine for the day. When they arrived, they saw the beautiful crystal clear water which faded into dark blue and sand. The sun was shining. May people were at the beach sitting on a variety of colors of towels or lounging in beach chairs with large brimmed hats shading their eyes from the sun. People were relaxing on shore and swimming in the water. Rachael decided she wanted to lie down on her towel and take a nap on the shore. 



Kaylie decided to head into the water to cool off first. On her way to the water, a small girl with freckles and yellow floaties darted in front of her followed by a little boy. This reminded Kaylie of beach days as a child with her brother. She looked towards the shore and saw a group of teenagers flying kites. She thought " What a wonderful and relaxing day at the beach". She returned to the sand to join her friend Rachael.
