Kaylie and her friend Rachel had a day off from work and decided to spend it at the beach. As they drove towards the parking lot they could see the crystal clear water spread out to the horizon with the big yellow sun looking like a marble hanging in the sky.  They walked towards the beach and saw it had many people already visiting it. There were people laying on yellow, pink, orange, and red towels and others sitting beneath umbrellas, others building sandcastles, and children playing. Rachel decided to take a nap on the beach and Kaylie decided to swim a bit in the ocean. As she walked to the ocean a young girl in a light blue swimsuit ran past followed by her younger brother in green trunks. She was reminded of her childhood spending days at the beach with her brothers. As she stood in the water shimmering like a thousand diamonds in the sea she took a breath and felt truly happy. She stood there for a while longer, savoring the moment, before returning back to where Rachel was and lied down next to her for a nap.
