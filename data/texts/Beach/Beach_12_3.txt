Rachel and Leah were two friends that decided to take the day off and head to the beach. It was extremely hot outside. When they got to the beach, it was extremely busy. Families were laying on beach towels, children were laying around, and people were tanning as well as reading. Rachel wanted to go relax in the water, while Leah went to settle down with a good book.

As Rachel headed to the water, she contemplated life and encountered a young girl and boy. The girl was running around as the boy followed after her. Rachel thought about how she and her brothers would come to beach when they were younger, and it made her nostalgic. She thought about how much fun they used to have, before they all got older. Rachel thought about how perfect this day at the beach was for her because she really need the relaxation time. 

She waded in the water for a bit as well as thought up fond childhood memories, then went to go join Leah.
