One summer day my friend and I decided to take advantage of our day off by going to the beach in Maine.  When we arrived at the beach we saw a lot of people under umbrellas, children playing, and people swimming.  My friend decided she wanted to lay out before she went swimming.  I decided to go for a swim.  While walking to the shore I was cut off by a little girl with freckles in a lavender bathing suit being chased by a little boy.  I smiled thinking about past beach memories with my own brothers.  I watched as teenagers flew kites.  When I was done swimming I decided to lay out with my friend.  It truly was a beautiful day.
