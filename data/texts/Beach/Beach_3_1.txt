It was a hot sunny day and Kaylie and Rachel decided to take advantage of their off day and go to the beach. The sun was an optimistic yellow pellet, blistering in the sky above as Kaylie and Rachel drove to Old Orchard Beach in Maine. When they came out of the parking lot they saw the beach was full of people. Some on yellow, orange, pink, and white towels while others were on lounge chairs, hats sheltering their faces from the run.



Rachel decided to lay down her towel and take a nap while Kaylie decided to go cool off in the ocean. As Kaylie approached she smooth clear water that faded to blue in the horizon, she noticed the sun sparkling off the surface making it look like thousands of tiny crystals. A girl in a little purple bathing suit with yellow floaties on her arms ran past her. She was closely followed by a boy in green swim trunks. Kaylie reminisced about earlier beach days spent with her brothers. As she spotted a group of teenagers flying colorful paragliders she decided that this was truly a perfect day. She closed her eyes and savored the moment for a few minutes before returning and laying down beside Rachel in the sand.
