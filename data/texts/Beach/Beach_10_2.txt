It was a hot and sunny day and Kaylie and Rachel decided to take advantage of their day off and go to the Old Orchard Beach in Maine.  The sun was a hot yellow pellet in the sky as the drove towards the beach.  There were people under umbrellas and also people wearing wide brimmed hats.  Little kids were building sandcastles and decorating them with smooth shells.  Kaylie decided she wanted to lay down before going into the ocean.  Rachel decided to go for a swim.  A little girl with freckles who was wearing a light purple bathing suit with floatys darted out in front of her followed by a little boy in green shorts.  Rachel smiled to herself thinking of the long past memories of her beach days with her brothers.  She saw a group of 4 teenagers playing with gliders.  As she walked over to lay down next to Kaylie she thought about what perfect day this was.
