It was a hot, sunny day and Kaylie and Rachel decided to take advantage of their off day by taking a trip to the beach. They hopped in the car and drive to Old Orchard Beach Maine. Once they arrived, they could see that the beach was full of people. Some were stretched out on yellow, orange, white, and pink towels, while other stretched out on lounge chairs, broad brimmed hats shielding their eyes from the rays of the sun. Kaylie decided to stretch out on her towel in the sand for a quick nap while Rachel went to cool off in the ocean. 

The sun shone off the water, making it look like a million crystals. Just before she reached the water, Rachel saw a girl in a light purple swimsuit with yellow floaties on her arms. The girl darted in front of Rachel, closely followed by a boy in green swimming short. Rachel smiled reminiscing on beach memories with her brothers. Once in the water, Rachel looked up and saw four teenagers sailing paragliders. She smiled and thought that this was the perfect place to be. Then she went to lay down in the sand with Kaylie.
