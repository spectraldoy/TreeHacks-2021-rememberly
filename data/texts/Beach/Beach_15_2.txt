One hot and sunny day, Kaylie and Rachel decided to take advantage of their off day and head to the beach. Walking from the parking lot, they saw the crystal clear water of Old Orchard Beach in Maine on the blue horizon.



Some people were on pink, orange, white, and yellow towels. Others were lying on beach chairs with thick-brimmed hats to avoid the suns' rays. Kaylie laid down as people made sandcastles around her. Rachel dipped into the water.



A little girl in a light purple bathing suit with little yellow floaties on her arms swam past her, followed by a boy in green trunks. Rachel thought of memories of swimming with her brothers. She decided to relish in the relief of her everyday anxieties. She joined Kaylie by the beachside.
