One hot, sunny summer day kaylie and Rachel decided to take advantage of their day off and go to the beach. They headed to Old Orchard Beach in Maine. The sun was a big, yellow pellet blistering in the sky. They parked and say the clear crystal ocean water that faded into deep blue in the horizon. The beach was swarming with people. They observed people on white, yellow, orange, and pink towels while some were on chairs. Kaylie decided to lay on her towel on the beach and take a nap while Rachel went to swim in the sea. Before Rachel reached the water a little girl in a light purple swim suit with little yellow floats ran in front of her chased by a boy in green swim trunks. This reminded Rachel of going to the beach with her brothers. Before she got out of the water she saw four teenagers with paragliders. The day was perfect. All the daily stresses seemed to fade away. She came out of the water and joined kaylie on a towel on the sand.
