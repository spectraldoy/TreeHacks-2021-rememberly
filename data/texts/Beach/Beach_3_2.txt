It was a hot, sunny day and Kaylie and Rachel decided to take advantage of their off day and go to the beach. The sun was an optimistic yellow pellet, blistering in the sky as they made their way to Old Orchard Beach in Maine. Once they arrived and walked from the parking lot, they saw the crystal clear water which turned into a deep blue by the horizon. The beach was swarming with people. Some on yellow, orange, pink or white towels, while other were on lounge chairs with wide brimmed hats shielding their eyes from the sun's rays. Children were making sand castles and decorating them with round sea shells. Kaylie decided to lay out on her towel and take a quick nap while Rachel went to go cool off in the ocean.



The sun on the water made it look like a million little crystals. Just as she was reaching the surf, Rachel spotted a little girl in a light purple bathing suit with yellow floaties on her arms. She was closely followed by a boy in green swim trunks. Rachel smiled as she reminisced about beach days with her brothers. After spending some time in the water, she saw some teenagers flying colorful paragliders. She thought that today was truly a perfect day, and all her anxieties about daily life melted away for a while. She closed her eyes for a few seconds to savor the moment before heading back to lie down beside Kaylie in the sand.
