Rachel and Kaylee wanted to take advantage of their day off, so they packed up their car and went to the beach. Once they got there, they could see the water sparkling and all the families there. The ocean faded into a deep blue on the horizon. Some people were laid out on white, yellow, pink, and orange towels, while others lounged on chairs with large-brimmed hats that kept the sun out of their eyes. Kaylee decided to lay out her towel for a quick nap while Rachel went down to cool off in the water. 

The sun sparkled off the waves like a million crystals. Before she got down to the water, a girl wearing a light purple bathing suit and floaties darted past, closely followed by a boy in green swimming shorts. Rachel smiled, remembering summers spent at the beach with her brothers. She went into the water and closed her eyes. When she opened them, she saw four teenagers flying a kite high in the sky. Rachel was able to forget about all her worries for a moment, and thought about how lucky she was to be right where she was. She then joined Kaylee in the warm sand.
