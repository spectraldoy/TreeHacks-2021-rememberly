One day, Kaylie and Rachel decided to take advantage of their off day and go to the beach.  The sun was like a yellow pellet that guided them to their location at Old Orchard Beach in Maine.  The beach was swarmed with people.  Towels of yellow, white, orange and pink covered the sand while adults wore hats with large brims to keep the sun out of their eyes.   Kaylie laid her towel down to take a nap in the sun, while Rachel went for a swim in the ocean.  



Just before Rachel got to the surf, she saw a little girl swim by in her purple bathing suit and her yellow floaties.  Followed closely behind her was a boy wearing bright green swim trunks.  This reminded Rachel of the summers she had as a child with her brothers swimming about.  This has really been the most perfect day, Rachel thought to herself as she felt all of the anxieties of life melt away for a while.  She swam towards the shore and left the ocean to go sit next to Kaylie and join her for a nap on the sand.
