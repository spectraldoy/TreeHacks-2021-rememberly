It was a beautiful day and two girls did not have work, so they decided to go to the beach. The sun was shining beautifully outside on this warm summer day. They arrived at the beach and from the parking lot, they could see the sun shining on the water that it looked like crystals. There were people laying on the beach in pink, yellow, white, and orange towels. Others were laying on chairs with hats to block the sun. One of the girls decided to lay on the beach, while the other decided to go into the water. As she was walking into the water, a young girl with a purple bathing suit and floaties cut right in front of her and a boy in a green swimsuit quickly followed behind her. This reminded her of the days when her and her brother were young and used to go to the beach. She took a moment to imagine how lucky she was on this beautiful day. After this, she ran out of the water and back to the beach to meet her friend.
