Once upon a time;

(during the summer)

In a land very far away,  like Conneticut or something;

There lived two young females, who are the subject of this interesting tale.



	These two females, being out of classes, since it was summer, set out to the beach to spend a day near the water.   One of them, stopped at the pool, and beagan to sunbathe. and the other female set out to build castles by the shore.  On her way to the shore, she saw many wondrous things like multicolored surf boards and bathing suits.  Purplee, green, yellow, and blue.  The boys bathing suit was purple. The girls, green.
