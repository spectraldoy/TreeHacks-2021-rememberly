It was a hot summer day when Kaylie and Rachel decided to take advantage of their day off to go to the beach. The sun was blaring down onto the sand as they arrived. The two had their beach towels all set and colorful as they went to lie out on the beach. Kaylie decided to lie on the beach towel and relax for a little bit while Rachel decided to cool off in the ocean. 



Rachel looked at the shining ocean waves. Just before she reached the surf, a young girl with freckles in a purple bathing suit ran in front of her. She thought back on her own childhood, playing with her brothers. She later saw two teenage boys  paragliding and continued to think about her life as a young child. She finally made it to the water and felt the cool waves splash against her feet.
