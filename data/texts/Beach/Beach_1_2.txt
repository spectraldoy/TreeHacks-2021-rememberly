It was a hot sunny day and Rachel and kaylie decided to take advantage of their day off from work. They decided to drive down to old orchard beach in maine. The sun was a blistering optimistic pellet in the sky. When they got there the ocean was bright blue and veered off into the horizon. People swarmed everywhere. They laid on pink, yellow, orange and white towels while other laid on lawn chairs with sun hats brimming their eyes and shielding them from the sun. Children ran around making sand castle with smooth shells. Kaylie went to lie down on a towel and Rachel went to cool off in the water

The sun was shining on the water making it glitter. A young girl ran past in a little purple bathing suit with yellow floaties. a boy was chasing her in a green bathing suit. It reminded Rachel of the days when she used to go to the beach with her brothers. She smiled she was absent of all anxieties at least for a little while. It really was a perfect day.
