It was a hot, sunny day and Kaylie and Rachel decided to take advantage of their day off and go to the beach.  The sun was a blistering yellow pellet in the sky as they drove to Orchard's Bay.  Walking from they parking lot, they could just see the clear water next to the horizon.  There were orange, yellow, and pink towels on the sand. Some adults had their eyes covered by long hats and were laying in beach chairs. The children were decorating smooth, sea shells.  Kaylie decided to lay down on the sand, while Rachel decided to go cool off in the ocean.

The sun's ray made the water look like a thousand of tiny crystals.  Before Rachel made it to the surf, a small girl with freckles ran past her in a purple bathing suit and yellow arm floaties.  A boy in a green bathing suit was chasing after her.  Rachel smiled as she reminisced on going to the beach with her brother.  She looked up and saw four teenagers flying paragliders.  Rachel thought about how great it was to clear her mind and then went back up to join Kaylie on the warm sand.
