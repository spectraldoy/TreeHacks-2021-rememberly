It was a hot sunny day in Maine and Kaylie and Rachel decided to take advantage of their day off and go to the beach. The sun was a yellow pellet in the sky blistering down on them. As they approached the beach they saw the crystal clear waters which faded into a deep blue on the horizon.  As the sun shone down on the water it looked like a million  sparkling diamonds. There were tons of people at the beach today. Some laid on pink, yellow, orange, and white blankets and some wore broad hats to shield their eyes from the rays. Children were decorating sandcastles with round shells. Kaylie decided to have a nap in the hot sun. Rachel decided to go to the ocean to cool off. As she approached the water she saw a young girl in a purple bathing suit with yellow floaties. The girl was quickly followed by a young boy in green swimming pants. Rachel reminisced about the times when her and her brothers would play at the beach. As she was standing in the surf she saw teenagers above gliding on paragliders. Rachel thought to herself today was truly a perfect day and all her anxieties from her daily life melted away. She walked back towards the beach and laid down by Kaylie for a nap.
