Rachel and Suzie were two friends who worked hard together and were good girls in general. One day, they decided to hit the beach. They lived in a coastal area, but obviously couldn't regularly find the time for sunny leisure.



They were met with the bright sun, the gentle sea breeze, and cozy, sandy shores, not to mention the beach denizens in similar, if not identical, spirits. They laid on their beach blankets together, until Rachel decided to swim. Suzie watched the different people basking in the rays in mirth.



She reminisced upon seeing a boy with his little sister in their bright bathing suits, reminding her of her childhood dalliances. Overall, it was a profound day.
