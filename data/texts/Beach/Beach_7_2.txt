It was a hot sunny day and Rachel and Kaylie decided to take advantage of their off-day and take a trip to the beach. The sun was a golden yellow pellet blistering in the sky as they went to Old Orchard Beach in Maine. On their way in from the parking lot, they noticed the crystal clear water sparkling blue. The beach was crowded with patrons. Some were laying out on towels that were yellow, orange, white or pink. Others were laying on lounge chairs with brimmed hats that were shading them from the sun. Kaylie decided to lay out on the beach and take a nap, while Rachel decided to go into the water to cool off.

The sun was glistening on the water that made it look like a lot of small crystals. Right before Rachel got to the surf, a young freckled girl in a purple bathing suit and yellow floaties on her arm cut in front of her. A boy with green swimming shorts followed closely after her. Rachel reminisced on memories with her brothers at the beach. A short while later, Rachel looked up and saw four teenage boys flying colorful paragliders in the sky. This was turning out to be a perfect day and Rachel felt all of her daily anxieties disappearing for a little while. She closed her eyes to savor the moment and then went to join Kaylie on the beach.
