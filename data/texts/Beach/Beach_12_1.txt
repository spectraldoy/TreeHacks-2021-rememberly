It was a hot sunny day and Kaylie and Rachel decided to take advantage of the day and go to the beach. The sun was an optimistic yellow pellet, blistering in the sky as they made their way to Old Orchard Beach in Maine. Once they arrived in the parking lot, they spotted the crystal clear sky that faded into a nice deep blue in the sky. There were lots of people at the beach, in a variety of beach towels. Children were decorating, round, smooth seashells and Kaylie decided to take a nap on her towel and Rachel wanted to cool off in the ocean.



Just before making it to the surf, Rachel saw a little girl with freckles in a purple bathing suit with yellow little floaties on her arm. The girl ran in front of Rachel, followed closely behind by a boy in green swim shorts. Rachel smiled as she thought of her own beach days wit her brothers. She spent some time on the water, looked up and saw 4 teens with colorful paragliders. She thought to herself how perfect the day had been and after a bit and how she'd gotten to forget all her worries and went to go join Kaylie.
