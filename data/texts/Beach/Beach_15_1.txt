One bright, sunny day, Kaylie and Rachel decided to use their off day to go to the beach. When they arrived at Old Orchard Beach in Maine, they saw the crystal clear water.



People were laying on white, orange, pink and yellow towels. Some were seen stretched on beach chairs with big hats to avoid the rays of the sun. Kaylie swam in the water while Rachel laid down. There was a little girl in a purple bathing suit with yellow floaties on her arms. A boy swam beside her. Kaylie thought fondly of swimming memories with her brothers.



She thought what a perfect day she was having, relieved of the usual stress. With this in mind, she joined her friend Rachel.
