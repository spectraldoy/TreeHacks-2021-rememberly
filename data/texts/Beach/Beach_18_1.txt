It was a hot and sunny day and Kaylie and Rachel decided to take advantage of their day off and go to the beach. The sun was an optimistic, yellow pellet, blistering as they drove to Old Orchard Beach in Maine. They pulled up and saw the crystal water as it faded into dark blue on the horizon. The beach was swarming with people. Some people had orange, yellow, white, or pink towels, while some were stretched out on lounge chairs with wide brimmed hats to protect themselves from the sun. 

	When they got to the beach, Kaylie decided to take a nap on her towel on the shore. Rachel decided to cool off in the ocean. A little girl in a purple bathing suit with yellow floaties darted past her, followed by a little boy in green swim shorts. She smiled as she reminisced about spending time with her brother. While she was in the ocean, she watched four teenagers fly colorful paragliders. She relaxed as she let all her anxieties go. Then she joined Kaylie for a nap in the sand.
