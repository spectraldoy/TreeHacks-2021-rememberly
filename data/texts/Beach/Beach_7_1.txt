It was a hot sunny day and Kaylie and Rachel decided to take advantage of their off-day so they decided to go to Old Orchard Beach in Maine. When they were walking from the parking lot, they noticed the sun was a bright yellow color and blistering through the sky and the water was a nice ocean blue. When they got to the beach, they noticed some people laying in the sand on pink, purple, yellow, and orange towels, while others were laying on beach chairs. Kaylie decided to lay on her towel and take a nap while Rachel decided to go in the water to cool off.

Rachel started walking into the water. She saw a small girl with freckles in a purple bathing suit cut in front of her in the water as she was being chased by a boy in a green bathing suit. This reminded her of the times that she would be in the water with her brothers. She then saw four teenagers flying paragliders. She closed her eyes to savor this perfect moment. She felt that all of her anxieties from her life just disappeared for a while. She then got out of the water and went to join Kaylie on the beach.
