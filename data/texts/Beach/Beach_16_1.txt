It was a hot, sunny summer day and Rachel and Kaylie decided to take advantage of their off day and head to the beach. The sun was an optimistic yellow pellet and upon arriving at the beach, the water glistened like a million crystals.



Some people were stretched out on yellow, pink, and white striped towels, while others were lounging in lawn chairs wearing wide-brimmed hats to protect their faces from the sun. 



Rachel decided to cool off in the water while Kaylie lay down on her towel for a quick nap. Children decorated sandcastles with smooth seashells. Rachel watched as a young girl in a purple bathing suit with yellow floaties darted in front of her, to join her mother, followed by a young boy in a green swimsuit. She reminisced about fond memories of beach days past spent with her mother and brothers.  Rachel also watched a group of 4 teenagers flying colorful hang-gliders above her. She then blissfully decided that today was a perfect day, as her anxieties drifted away. She enjoyed the ocean water for a bit longer before returning to the shore to join Kaylie to lie down on the warm sand.
