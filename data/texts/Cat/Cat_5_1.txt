AT BREAKFAST, MY CAT SUSIE SITS ON THE DECK OF THE POOL, NEAR THE GLASS DOORS TO OUR KITCHEN. Bang, bang. This means "Ryan, feed me" in Susie's special language. I get up and feed her. I know this because I know everything about her, or at least I think I do. For the life of me, I cannot figure out where Susie goes at noon. At 11:30, I notice that Susie is not home.  Where has she gone? I walk out the door and notice her walking down the street, and I follow. I follow her towards the traffic light, and again as she rounds a corner. I start to think that I know where she is going. At the back of the Fresh Fish Market, Mr. Johnson brings out the trash. He then sets a plate of fish heads on the ground. "Hello Ryan," he calls. "So this is where Susie goes at noon," I laugh. He laughs. "Yes, the cats used to tear my garbage up, so now I leave the fish heads out separately. Is this your Susie?" I nod. "She's here everyday." I wait for Susie to finish eating and we walk home together.
