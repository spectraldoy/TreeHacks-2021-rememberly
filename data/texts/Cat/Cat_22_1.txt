At breakfast, his cat Susie sits at the glass door every morning. She taps on it which her owner, Ryan, believes is her telling him she's waiting for him to feed her. Her owner thinks he knows everything about his cat Susie and what she's trying to say except where she goes everyday around noon. 



One day at 11:30, Ryan notices Susie has disappeared and he finds her trotting down the road towards town. He quickly gets up to follow her and find out where she is going. He follows her into town, behind the small strip mall and figures out where she's going. There is a fish market at the back of the strip mall. As Ryan turns the corner towards the fish market he spots Susie joining some of her cat collegues at the back door. Just then, the owner of the fish market opens the door. He takes out the trash and then pulls out a clear bag of fish heads, dumping them onto the ground for the cats. He notices Ryan and says hello in his Brooklyn accent. He said the cats used to tear up his garbage so now he just gives them the fish heads every day at noon. He asks ryan if Susie is his cat. Ryan says yes and the man tells him Susie comes there everyday at noon to eat his fish.
