There was a man who loved his cat very dearly. This man fed his cat, Susie, every day, and thought he knew everything about her. However, one thing he didn't know was where she would disappear to each day at noon. So, one day he saw her walking towards town, and he decided to follow her.

He had no idea on earth where she could possibly be going. Soon, though, her destination became clear. They were headed to a fish market. The man knew the owner of the fish market. When they arrived at the fish market, Susie met up with the other neighborhood cats and together they waited by a dumpster. The back door to the fish market opened, and out came the owner. He threw away a large black garbage bag and pulled out a clear plastic bag filled with fish heads. He gave these fish heads to the cats, who swarmed around the meal enthusiastically. 

The owner looked over and saw Susie's owner. He walked over to him and told him how he used to throw away the fish heads in the garbage each day, but he realized the cats wouldn't stop getting into his dumpster to eat the fish. So, he decided to just start saving them the leftover fish heads each day. Susie's owner was happy, because he'd finally figured out where Susie had been disappearing to at noon each day. He waited until she had finished up her meal, then together they walked back home.
