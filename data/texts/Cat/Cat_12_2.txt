At breakfast, my cat Susie sits on the deck of the pool, outside the glass doors to the kitchen. Bang, bang. She hits the door with her paw meaning, "Ryan, feed me".  So, I get up from my chair and feed her. I know this, because I know everything about Susie, or at least I think I do. But I don't know where Susie goes at noon.



At 11:30 on Saturday morning I notice she's not home. Then I spot her trotting down the street towards town. I wonder where in the world she's going. Then she heads towards the strip mall and I realize where she's headed.



Behind the strip mall there's a small white building called Mr.Johnston's Fish Market. I turn the corner and see Susie and her cat friends there. Out of the building comes Mr.Johnston, carrying a large garbage bag. He throws out fish heads for the cats to eat and they pounce. He spies me lurking and comes over to me.



In his thick Brooklyn accent, he says, "Hi Ryan", and I respond, "So this is where Susie comes at noon." Mr.Johnston laughs and says , "Yes. All the cats come to see me at noon. They used to mess up my garbage, so now I just put the fish heads on the ground for them. Is that your cat?" Susie ignores me. "She comes here every day." I wait for Susie to finish then we head home together.
