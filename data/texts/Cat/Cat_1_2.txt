At  breakfast my cat Susie waits outside to eat. Bang bang is the sound of her paws hitting the sliding glass door that leads into the kitchen. I let her in and we eat breakfast together. I like to think I know everything about Susie. I do not know where she goes at noon.

On Saturday at 1130 I notice Susie is gone. I see her outside trotting down the road. I quickly follow. I follow her down the road towards the traffic light and go past the corner store and head towards the strip mall. I start to think I know where she is going. 

Mr. Johnson has a fish market at the end of the mall. As we get close I watch him put two large trash bags into the dumpster and pull out a small clear bag full of fish heads. I see Susie has been joined by her cat colleagues, Mr Johnson sees me and calls out in his thick accent.
