AT BREAKFAST MY CAT SUSIE SITS by the pool.  It,s ten oclock on a sunny nice day.   I knew Susie my cat, who comes over to great me, seems to know every little thing about me, however I don<t about her.  For instance even thpough it is 11:30 as she is greeting me, as Susie, my cat does , putrring and arching her back.  I have no idea where, siusie goes at noon on a Sunday.   

	Susie takes off and I follow her thinking I know where shes going.  However I am surprised when it is Mr. Johnston<s fish shack.  Mr Johnsaton sells fish.   Susie goes over to a trout head on the floor. Mr. Jis taking out the trash , says he used tkol put the garbahge , however dozen cats would s get into.  So now he puts the the fish heads on the floor.

I waiot foe sussie to finish eating her tasty fish head, and then we walk home together.
