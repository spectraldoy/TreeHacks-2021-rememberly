Ryan had a cat named Susie and he thought he knew almost everything about her. When she knocked on the glass door to the kitchen at the back of the house, he knew it meat "Ryan, feed me". However, he didn't know where Susie would go every day at noon.

	One Saturday morning at 11:30 am, he noticed she was missing. He looked outside and saw her walking down the street towards town, so he followed her. She turned a corner, walked past shops, and crossed the street at a stoplight before heading behind a small strip mall. Ryan recognized that she was heading to a fishmonger's shop behind the mall. Many other cats joined Susie in waiting by the back door to the fish market, and at noon the owner came out with bags of trash, which he threw into the dumpster, and a bag of fish heads. He spilled them out onto the ground and the cats immediately descended upon the fish. He greeted Ryan with a heavy Brooklyn accent and Ryan told him that Susie was his cat. The owner told Ryan that Susie had come every day to his shop, and she and Ryan walked home after.
