My cat Susie sits outside on the pool deck outside of the glass doors out of the kitchen. Bang bang! She hits the door with her paw, which means "Ryan feed me!" in her Susie language. I know everything about Susie. At least I think I do. For the life of me, I don't know where Susie goes at noon every day. 

	At 11:30 I don't know where Susie is. I see her trotting down the street and quickly follow. She turns the corner and starts towards town. She is walking towards the strip mall. I know where Susie is going. 

	Mr. Johnston's Fish Market is a small white building in the back corner of the strip mall. I hide around a corner and watch while Susie and her cat colleagues meet up behind the fish market. Mr. Johnston comes out with a large trash bag and a small plastic bag filled with fish heads. He says "Hey Ryan" and he tosses the fish heads on the ground for the cats. We watch them pounce on them. He asks which one is mine and I point out my Susie. However, Susie is too interested in the fish head at the moment to notice me. Mr. Johnston told me that he gives the cats fish heads to distract them from the garbage because they used to tear it up. After Susie finishes, we walk home together.
