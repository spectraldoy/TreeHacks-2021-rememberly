At breakfast, Susie sits outside by the pool. She taps twice on the glass door to the kitchen, and this means "Ryan feed me" in her special language. I know everything about Susie, or at least I think I do. For the life of me, I do not know where she goes everyday at noon.

On Saturday morning at 11:30, I notice Susie is missing. I don't know where she could be, so I walk outside to look for her. I notice her walking down the street towards town, so I follow her. She passes the corner store and I see her headed for the strip mall. I think I know where she's going.

Mr. Johnston's Fresh Fish Market is a white building at the back of the strip mall. Susie gets there and meets some of her cat colleagues. Mr. Johnston walks out the back of the store carrying a few black trash bags and puts them in the dumpster. Then he is carrying a small, clear white bag of fish heads. He spreads them out on the ground and the cats pounce on them.

Mr. Johnston sees me lurking in the back and comes up and says "Hi Ryan". He asks if one of the cats is mine and I say, "Susie is mine". She is too busy eating the fish and is not interested in me. I tell him that "I never knew where Susie is at noon" and he tells me "Susie is here everyday". Mr. Johnston leaves and goes back into the store. I wait for Susie to finish eating so that we can walk home together.
