Every day I watch my cat Susie as she taps on the glass door with her paw after breakfast on the back deck. I think I know what she is thinking, since we've been together for many years. However, I still do not know where she goes every day at noon.



One time I decide to follow her, and she begins by trotting down the street toward the traffic light until she reaches a strip mall down the road. Eventually, she joins her cat colleagues outside Johnston's Fresh Fish Market. Mr. Johnston empties several large black garbage bags of cut fish heads on the ground and watched the cats pounce on them. After noticing me lurking in the shadows, Mr. Johnston calls out "Yes Ryan, this is where Susie comes every day at noon."



Susie does not acknowledge me; apparently she is too busy devouring her meal. I then wait for Susie to finish her fish head and we subsequently walk back home together down the main street from the strip mall location.
