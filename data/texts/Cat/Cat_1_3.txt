This guy had a cat named Susie and she pawed at the glass door to be let in for breakfast every morning. The guy knew everything about Susie except where she went at noon. One Saturday he noticed Susie was missing and quickly ran outside. He saw her darting down the road and decided to follow her. She went down a couple blocks and went past the corner store. He started to realize where she was going. There was a fish market at the end of the strip mall. Susie was joined by her cat colleagues. He followed Susie to the mall where the fish-man was discarding of the excess fish. He pulled out a clear bag full of fish heads and through them down to the cats. The man saw me watching the cats and called out in a thick accent "Which ones yours?" I pointed to Susie and the man said yup she is here everyday. Susie was too busy with the fish head to notice me. When she was done we walked home together.
