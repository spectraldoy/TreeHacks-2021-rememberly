I can understand the language of my cat as we have a great way of communicating. I am eating breakfast in the kitchen and she is outside, and I see her tap her paws on the glass kitchen door which means she is hungry. I feed her and I know everything that she does, except where she goes at noon. On Saturday around 11:30, I notice she disappears. I look outside and see her walking down the sidewalk so I follow her. She goes past the general store and I think I know where she is heading. We see a strip mall and in the back of the mall is a Fresh Fish Market. She goes around to the back of the Market behind the mall and I follow her. I see a bunch of other cats there and she is interacting with her cat colleagues. I then see the owner of the fish market come out with black trash bags to drop them in the dumpster. I also see him carrying a clear bag with fish heads, and he dumps it on the ground for all of the cats to eat. The owner then comes up to me and asks if one of the cats eating the fish was my cat. I reply that Susie was my cat and that I never knew where she went at noon. I try to talk to her but she is not listening as she is too concentrated on eating the fish. He replies that she is here every day. He used to dump all of the fish heads in the trash, but the cats would also rip open the bags and just eat the fish so now he puts them in a separate bag for the cats. He goes back inside and I wait for Susie to finish eating. We then walk down the street together back to our house.
