At breakfast, Ryan's cat Susie sits at the pool deck outside of the back door. She taps on the door which means "feed me Ryan" in her own special language. Ryan thinks he knows everything about Susie except he does not know where she goes everyday around noon. Ryan notices Susie is gone around 11:30 one day and he spots her trotting down the street towards town. He quickly gets up to follow her. He follows her to the red light, past the corner store and toward the small strip mall. As he goes around the back of the strip mall he realizes she is heading to Mr. Johnston's fresh fish market located in a small white building around the back of the strip mall. He sees Susie join a group of her cat colleagues and watches as MR. Johnston appears from the back door, places the garbage bags in the trash and spreads the remaining clear bag of fish heads across the ground for the cats. He notices Ryan lurking around the corner and says hello in his Brooklyn accent. Ryan says "So this is where Susie goes everyday at noon". Mr. Johnston asks which cat is Susie. She pays no attention to Ryan. He tells Ryan she comes everyday before heading back. Ryan waits for Susie to finish eating
