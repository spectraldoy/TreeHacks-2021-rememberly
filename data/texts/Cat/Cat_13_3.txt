I sat down near the window at my house on a Sunday afternoon.   At about eleven something, my cat Susie came by and meowed for me to open the door.  Susie was affectionate, and seemed to know all my intracies and everything she needed to know about me, however there were still some things I did not know about Susie.  Like for instance where did Susie sopnd her her time in the afternoon, on the weekend.  

	Iwas deter,mined to discover this, so when she went running out the door; I followed her.   She passed the shopping center on and the store on the corner; and headed towards downtown.  She went behinfd the old shopping center.   There suse was surrounded by a dozen other cats feastinfg on fish.   A familiar man said my name, as he was bringing out the trash to the garbage, and stated he used to thriow away the fish however now he leaves them out.
