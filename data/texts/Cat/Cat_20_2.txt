At breakfast everyday Susie sits on the deck by the pool. Bang bang. She hits the glas door with her paw. This means " I want my breakfast ryan." I know just about everything about Susie, except where she goes at noon everyday. At about 11:30am i find that Susie isn't a home. I spot her outside heading down the street. She turns the corner and heads down the block towards the traffic light. She turns and starts heading toward the strip mall. I think I know where she is heading. Mr. Johnston's Fresh Fish Market is a white building behind the strip mall. I watch Susie join several other cats behind the building. Mr. Johnston carries out several black trash bags and puts them into the dumpster. He then pulls out a white bag with fish heads and scatters them. The cats pounce on th fish heads. He spots me and says, "hello ryan" in his thick brooklyn accent. "So this is where susie goes everyday". "Yes, she is here everyday". I let her finish her fish head and we both head back home together.
