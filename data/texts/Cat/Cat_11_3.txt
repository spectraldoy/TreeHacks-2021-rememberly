I have a cat named Susie who stays outside and scratches at the back door everyday so I can feed her. We communicate great and I always feel like I know what she is thinking. However, everyday at noon Susie leaves and I have no idea where she goes. One day, I caught her walking off and decided to follow her down the sidewalk. As I walked behind her, we passed the stoplight and then behind the strip mall until we got to the back of Smiths fish market. Susie was greeted there by many of her other cat friends and they waiting until Mr. Smith came out the back door. He was holding a big black garbage bag which he emptied and then pulled  a clear plastic bag with fish heads out. He began to distribute the fish heads to all fo the cats. When he looked up and saw me I said "so this is where susie goes everyday at noon". He smiled and said in his thick Brooklyn accent that he was tired of them going through his trash so he thought this was a better idea. After that I never worried about where Susie went at noon.
