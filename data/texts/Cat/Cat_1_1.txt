At breakfast my cat Suzie sits on the deck of the pool. Bang- bang she hits the window waiting for her breakfast. I let her inside and feed her.  I would like to think I know everything about Suzie. Except I do not know where she goes at noon. 

I look for her around 11:30 and I see her trotting down the road. I follow her and she turns a few corners and I see her go towards the mall. I think I know where she is going. There is a fish market behind the mall. I follow her there and watch as the guy put the remains of the fish In the trash and throws the heads on the ground for the cats. I watch suzie tear up the fish head. Which one is yours he asks and I point to suzie. Yup she is here everyday he says. Suzie pays no attention to me she is busy with the fish head at the moment. Suzie finishes and we walk home together
