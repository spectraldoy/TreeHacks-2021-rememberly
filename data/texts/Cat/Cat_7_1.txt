At breakfast, Susie sits on the ground and watches me eat. She taps her paw two times on the door. That is her signal for communicating with me and she says "Ryan I am hungry". I feed her at about 10:30 in the morning. I know everything that Susie does, or at least I think I do. For the life of me, I do not know what she does at noon.

At around 11:30 in the morning, Susie leaves the house and walks down the street. I follow her as she is walking towards the strip mall. There is a fish market at the back of the strip mall that she walks towards.  Susie joins all of her colleagues at the back of the fish market. I see Mr. Johnston at the fish market, and he is taking out his trash. He puts three black trash bags into the dumpster, and then spreads the heads of the fish out on the ground for the cats. 

The cats go crazy and eat all of the fish heads. I talk to Mr. Johnston and he asks which cat is mine. I point to Susie and tell him that I never know where she is at noon. Mr. Johnston tells me that she is here everyday. I try to talk to Susie but she is too focused on the fish head that she doesn't pay attention to me. I wait for Susie to finish eating and then we walk down the street back to my house together.
