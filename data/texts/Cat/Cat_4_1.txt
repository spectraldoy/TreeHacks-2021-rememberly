Every day, my cat Susie knocks on the door with her paw. "Bang bang." This is her way of saying "feed me" in her special cat language. I know this because I know everything about Susie. But for the life of me, I do not know where Susie goes at noon.



One day, I decided to follow her. It was 11:30 AM and I realized that Suzie was not around. I looked outside to see her walking down the street. I followed her as she approached the strip mall. I noticed a lot of cats. Suddenly, I had an idea of where she was going. Johnson's fish market is nearby.



I approached Johnson and he said "Hi there!" in his Brooklyn accent. I saw as he took out his garbage and laid out fish heads and a bunch of cats pounced on them. I said, "So this is where Susie goes at noonâ€¦" He explained to me that cats used to always rummage through his garbage, so now he lays the fish heads out for them instead. He said, "Is this your Susie?" I nodded yes, and Susie was too engrossed in the fish to notice me. After they finished eating, Susie and I walked back home together.
