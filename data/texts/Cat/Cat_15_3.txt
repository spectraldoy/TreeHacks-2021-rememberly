I thought I knew everything about my cat, Suzie. Everything except where she goes at noon. One day, curiosity had gotten the best of me (like my cat),  and I followed Suzie leaving the house around 11 am.

She led me through the neighborhood and into town, turning at the end of a shopping center. I intuited that she was going to Sal's Fish Market. There she was at the back door, and within a minute, Sal himself exited through the building with a clear bag of fish heads. Cats came from all around. He spread the fish thoroughly as the cats chomped down.

Seeing me, he replied, "It keeps them out of my trash. They tended to tear it up before I started doing this." After eating her heart's content, Suzie joined me and we walked in stride back home.
