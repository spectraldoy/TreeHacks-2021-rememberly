At breakfast, my cat Susie is on the deck of the pool, right outside the glass doors of the kitchen, and she hits the glass twice. Bang bang. This is her way of saying "Ryan, feed me. " I know this because I know everything about Susie, at least, so I thought.

I notice Susie is gone at noon everyday but don't know where.



The next day, at 11:30 I notice Susie leaving home. I decide to follow her. I follow her all the way to Mr. Johnston's Fish Market, where Susie and several other cats are gathered. I see Mr.Johnston come outside with a big bag of trash and some fish heads. He dumps the fish heads on the ground for the cats to eat and walks over to me.



I remark that this is where Susie has been going everyday at noon. He says yes, the cats used to tear up his garbage looking for fish, so now he just  compiles his fish heads for the cats and it stops them from messing up his trash. Finding the situation hilarious, I wait until Susie is done with her fish head then she and I walk home together.
