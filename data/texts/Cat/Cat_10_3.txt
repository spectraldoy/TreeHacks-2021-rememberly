One morning my cat Susie was lounging on the pool cover next to the kitchen window .  I could tell that she was waiting to be fed her breakfast.  I know this because I know everything about Susie.  Well, almost everything.  For the life of me I cannot tell where she goes every afternoon.  One Saturday morning I noticed Susie was missing.  I looked for her all over the house when I looked at the front window and saw her walking down the street towards town.  She was heading past the street light, past the pharmacy.  I followed her and had a good idea of where she was going.  She when around an alley next to Johnson's Fish Market.  I watched as Mr. Johnson's opened the door and through out a bag of trash.  Then he opened a clear bag of fish heads and started handing them out to the cats standing around him.  Mr. Johnson noticed me watching him and asked "Are any of these cats yours?"  I nodded and pointed out to Susie who was not remotely interested in me as she was busy eating her fish head.  Mr Johnson said "They come every afternoon, they use to tear up my trash until I started giving them the fish heads".  With that he turned around went back inside.  I waited for Susie to finish her fish head and then we walked home together.
