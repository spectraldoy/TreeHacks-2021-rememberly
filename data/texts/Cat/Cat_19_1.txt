At breakfast, my cat Susie is sitting out on the deck by the pool. I hear her paw at the door. Bang, bang. Susie is telling me she is hungry in her own language. I know this because I know everything about Susie. Or at least, I think I do. For the life of my, I  have no idea where she goes at noon every day. 



On Saturday morning, at 11:30, I look out the door and see Susie trotting down the street. I have no idea where she is going so I decide to follow her. She goes to the end of the street where she meets some of her other cat friends. 



She then goes to the center of town to the Mr. Johnston's restaurant with her friends. I peak around the corner and see him throwing fish heads onto the ground for the group of cats to start eating. 



I walk up to Mr. Johnston, who says, "Hi Ryan." "So this is where Susie goes every day at noon?"  He asks, "One of these is yours? Which one is Susie?"
