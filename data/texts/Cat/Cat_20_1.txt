Every morning my cat Susie sits on the pool deck outside the glass doors. I hear a bang, bang and know that this is her way of asking for breakfast. I let her inside and feed her. I know just about everything about Susie. Although I don't know where she goes every day at noon. At about 12:30 I spot her walking down the street, I decide to follow her. She approaches the street lights , passes a white building, and heads town the shopping mall. I bet she is headed towards Mr. Johnston's Fresh Fish market. I watch as Mr. Jphnston comes outside with a black trash bag and he throws this into the garbage. He then pulls out a white trash bag with fish heads. Many cats have gathered around and Susie is one of them. Mr. Johnston spreads out the fish heads and then notices me. He calls out " hello Ryan." I exclaim "so this is where she goes everyday."
