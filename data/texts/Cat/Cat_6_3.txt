Everyday at  noon, my car, Susie disappears. One day she is sitting by the pool, then comes to the back glass door and scratches on it. That means she wants food. Noon comes around and I see my Susie walking down the street. Curious to see where she goes every day, I get up to follow her. She walks down the street, the turns the corner. After a while, I realize where she is going. There is a fishers market behind the shopping center. I follow here there and see the owner taking out trash. I say hello. I next see him lay a clear plastic bag of fish heads on the ground, then tons of cats come rushing out towards the bag to eat. I smile, because now I know where Susie goes every day at noon. When she is done, we talk back home together.
