On a Saturday morning at 10am, I heard the familiar bang bang bang of my Susie knocking on the door. This means that she is hungry and it is breakfast time. I know this because I know my cat Susie like the back of my hand. But for the life of me, I do not know where Suzie goes at noon. 

One day, I noticed Susie went missing at 11:30 AM. I quickly opened my door to see her trotting down the street. I followed her and then I noticed that at the stop light, she turned. I saw her approaching a local strip mall and immediately had an idea where she was going. I saw many of her cat colleagues joining her. There was a fish shop behind the strip mall called Mr. Johnston's Fish Market.

When I arrived at the Market, I saw Mr. Johnston take out 8 large black trash bags, and one clear smaller trash bag full of fish heads. As he was taking out the trash, he threw the fish heads on the ground and before I knew it, cats from all over were eating. I looked at Mr. Johnston and said, "So this is where Susie goes at noon…" He explained, "I used to toss these fish heads out with the trash, but then they all just dug through my trash. Now every day at 12 this is what I do! Is this your Susie?" I nodded my head, but Susie did not notice—the fish head was more important right now. After she finished, we walked back home together.
