On Saturdays, Susie likes to spend the mornings lounging by the pool in the sun. The man who is her owner was eating breakfast at the kitchen table when he heard bang bang bang! On the glass door that led outside. That is Susie's indication that she wants breakfast. He knows that because he knows everything about Susie. Well almost everything. For the life of him, he does not know where Susie goes at noon. 

Around 1130, he notices that Susie is nowhere to be found. He goes out towards the street and sees her walking towards town. He decides to follow her to see where she goes at noon. She walked for a few blocks then came to a street light in town. She turned at the block that brings you to a small strip mall. When she got to the strip mall, she walked behind into the alleyway behind the stores. There were a bunch of cats behind the fish store! 

Then at noon, a man came out carrying a few large, black trash bags. He heaved them up into the dumpster and then pulled a clear plastic bag out of his pocket that had fish heads in it. He threw these heads to the cats. He then turned and saw the owner. He said hi and asked if this was his cat. The owner said, "yes that's my Susie!". But Susie ignored him, she was too busy eating her fish head. He said, "so this is where she goes at noon". The man said that the cats used to destroy his garbage so now he brings out fish heads so they eat that and not the garbage. Then he walked back inside the store. The owner waited for Susie to finish her snack and then they walked back together towards home.
