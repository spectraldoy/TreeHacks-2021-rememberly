One day, I was at the grocery store and had the next two weeks worth of groceries in my shopping cart, when I decided to check out. As a approached the clerk, I felt in my back pocket where my money was, only to discover it was not there. I knew I had brought it in, because I left my pocketbook in my car. It must have fallen out! I looked at the other people in line behind me, trying to figure out what to do, and thinking about the rest of the money in my car, just enough for this month's rent. The checkout clerk suggested I go to the customer support desk to see if anyone had turned any money in. I scoffed at the idea, "It was cash! Who would turn that in?" Nevertheless, I decided it couldn't hurt to investigate. I approached the service counter, "Excuse me. Nobody's turned any money in today, have they?" "As a matter of fact, there has been. How much?" I told her the amount, and was amazed to discover my money had been turned in. "Who did this? I must know so I can thank them!" I exclaimed. The service clerk motioned to a woman and her daughter, "She found it and turned it in." I rushed toward them, thanking the mother.
