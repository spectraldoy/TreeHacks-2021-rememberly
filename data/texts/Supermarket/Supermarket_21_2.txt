I was shopping at my local grocery store as I had done for years.  I had just got about two weeks worth of groceries and was going to the register to pay.  I reached into my back right pocket to grab the money but it wasn't there.  I started to get nervous.  I though back to the check book in the car and knew that I had taken the money out and put it in my pocket. I thought the rest of the money that was in the car that was suppose to pay for rent. I gave the cashier and weird look and she told me to go check at the courtesy counter.  I laughed and said "but it's money, no one will hand that in!"

	I figured it was worth a shot and went to the lady at the courtesy counter.  I asked if anybody had turned in any money.  She replied, "yes, actually somebody has! How much?"  I got excited!  "$200 in the form of twenty dollar bills," I replied.  "I have it!" she responded.  I was so happy that I asked, "who turned it in? I want to thank them." She pointed to a girl about 10 years old. I ran over and gave the mom a hug, but the mom responded, "it wasn't me, it was my daughter."  From the day I decided to pay forward the act of kindness every opportunity that I had.
