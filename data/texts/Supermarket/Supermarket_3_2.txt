I was shopping at my local supermarket as I had normally done for years. One particular day I had done about 2 weeks' worth of shopping and was heading to the register to pay for my groceries. I reached into my back right pocket to get the money to pay and realized that there was no money in there. I had left my pocketbook in the car, but I was sure that I had put the money in my back right pocket. There were other people behind me in line for the register, and I started to get nervous. I thought about the money I had left in the car that was intended to pay rent that month. I gave a confused look to the cashier, who suggested I go the courtesy desk. I laughed, "it was cash! Who would hand that in?"

	I decided there was no harm in checking. I went up to a women behind the desk and asked, "did anyone by chance hand in cash?" "How much?" She asked. My face then lit up. "$200 dollars in the form of twenty dollar bills." "Why yes, actually, they did." She handed me the money. "Who," I asked, "I want to thank them." She pointed to a girl, about 10 years old. "She did." I went over and hugged the mother. "Actually, it was my daughter," she said. I was so happy I was in tears. In those moments I promised that I would always do my duty and pay forward that act of kindness.
