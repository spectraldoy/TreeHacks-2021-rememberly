I was shopping at my local supermarket like I've done for years. That particular day I was shopping for food. I got up to the counter and reaches my hand into my back right pocket. There was nothing there. I gave the cashier a confused look. I knew I had the money in my back right pocket because I had taken out of my pocket book in the car. I must have left it somewhere. That money was meant to be  for my rent that month. The cashier told me to go to the courtesy counter. I laughed and said no one would turn in cash. I went to the counter and asked anyways. The lady said "how much." I immediately smiled with relief. "200 in 20s" I said with a grin. Yes as a matter of fact someone did. When I asked who she pointed to a ten year old in the corner. I eagerly went over and hugged her mom. The mom said it wasn't me it was my daughter thank her. I knew from that moment forward I was do try to do as many acts of kindness as I possibly could.
