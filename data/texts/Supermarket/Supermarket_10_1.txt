I was shopping at my local grocery store as I usually do.  This particular trip I was shopping for 2 week's worth of groceries.  I was in the check out line when I reached in my back pocket for the money to pay when I realized there was nothing there.  I looked at the cashier in confusion.  I remembered that I had left my pocketbook in the car and I swear I remember putting the money in my back pocket.  I explain the cashier what has happened and she told me to " Check with the courtesy counter" to which I replied "But it's cash! Nobody turns in cash!"



I went to the courtesy counter where I asked if anyone has turned in some money.  She immediately replied "How much?".  To which I excitedly replied "$200, in increments of 20".  The woman at the courtesy counter said that someone had turned in that amount.  When I asked her who it was she pointed to a 10 year old girl.  I walked over to the mom and gave her a hug, and she said "It wasn't me it was my daughter".  From that day forward I decided that I was going to pay it forward.
