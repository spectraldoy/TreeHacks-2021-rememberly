One particular day I was shopping at the local grocery store I had attended for years. I had about two weeks' worth of groceries and was headed to the register. I reached into my back pocket for the cash to pay, but nothing was there. I panicked. I had my checkbook but it was all the way in the car. I looked at the cashier with confusion. There were people on the line, and I thought the cash was in my right back pocket. She told me to see the contact counter. "But it was cash," I laughed and said, "Who would turn that in?"



I asked the counter lady if anyone by any chance had turned in some cash. "Why yes actually," she said. "Two hundred dollars in rolled up twenties." I ask who turned it in and she pointed to a ten-year old girl. I ran up to hug and thank the mother, who said, "It wasn't me. It was my daughter." I was so grateful in that moment that I decided to repay any act of kindness.
