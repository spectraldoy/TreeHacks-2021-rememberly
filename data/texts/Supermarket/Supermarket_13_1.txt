I  was shooppoing at my local marketsuper as I had done for years.  And when I was in line and reached to pay, I went to back right pocket,.  My back right pocket was empty.  The back right pocket was where I had placed the money in the car, which was intended to pay this months rent, however there were quite a lot of people behind me.  I was getting anxious, near panic.  The lady said, perhaps you should goa ask someone at the courtesy counter.



I did ask.  They said to my astonishment, how much.  ?  I rejoiced and stated @200 in larhge bills.  10 twenties,.  She said that's exactly how much s! has turned in..   Who I inquired, I wanted to thank them.  Pointing at alil girl, I thank the mother . it wsnt mre. It was her.

Pay it forward.
