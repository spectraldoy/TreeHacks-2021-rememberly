I was shopping at my local grocery store, like I do every week. This particular week I was shopping for two week's worth of groceries. I approached the register and went to pay, and as I reached into my back pocket, I noticed my money was not there. I started to get nervous and I panicked as I looked at the line behind me at the register. My mind immediately went to my wallet in my car, but then I remembered my money in there was supposed to pay rent for this month. I looked at the cashier with a worried look on my face and told her what had happened. She told me to check the customer counter. I laughed and said, who would turn in cash? But I decided there was no harm in checking.

	

	I then approached the customer service counter. I asked the lady if she had any money turned into her recently. She said, "How much?" My eyes immediately lit up. "200 dollars in 20 dollar bills." She said, "Yes! I have had that turned into me, actually." I breathed a sigh of relief. "Tell me who turned it in," I said. She pointed at a little girl and her mom in the line. I immediately ran over to her mom and hugged her. "It wasn't me," she said, "it was my daughter!" I thanked the young girl. I felt so much relief. It was in that moment that I decided that I would do whatever I can to pay this act of kindness forward in the future.
