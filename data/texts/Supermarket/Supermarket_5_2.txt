I was shopping at my local supermarket as I normally have for years. One particular day, I had done about 2 weeks worth of shopping and went to the register to pay for it. I reached into my back right pocket and noticed there was no money in there. I started to get nervous. My pocketbook was in the car and I was sure I had put the money in my back right pocket. I looked at the cashier, not knowing what to do. There were people behind me in line and I immediately thought of my pocketbook in the car with the money intended to pay this month's rent. The cashier told me to visit the courtesy counter. I laughed. "But it was in cash, no one would hand that in!"

I decided there was no harm in checking, so I walked up to the woman behind the counter and said "I have to ask, did anyone turn in cash by any chance?" She asked, "How much?" My face then lit up. "$200 in the form on 20 dollar bills." "Actually yes, someone did!" I was surprised. "Who was it? I want to thank them." She pointed to a 10-year-old girl and said "She did." I went over and gave the mother a hug, who said "Actually it wasn't me, it was my daughter." I was almost in tears. I decided in those moment to pay this act of kindness forward every opportunity I got.
