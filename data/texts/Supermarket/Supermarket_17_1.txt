I was shopping at my local grocery store, as I had done for the last 5 years or so.  One day I went into the grocery store to get 2 weeks of groceries.  As I was ready to pay, I noticed that my money was missing.  I started to panic, and check around me for my money.  I knew that I had left my pocketbook in my car and left the money I was going to pay my rent with there too.  I saw people behind me in line, and I started to get very nervous.  The cashier said that I should go check with the courtesy counter.  But I told her, "It was 200 dollars, no one is going to turn that in!"



I decided to give it a shot and I went to the counter.  I asked, "Did anyone turn in money?"  The woman behind the counter said, "How much was it?"  Excitedly, I said back, "200 dollars in the form of 20 dollar bills!"  It turns out that the money had been turned in.  She pointed to a woman that had turned in the money, it was a mother and her daughter., who looked to be about 10 years old.  I went to the mother and gave her a hug.  She said to me, "It wasn't me, it was my daughter".  I then decided to make sure that I was doing my best to pay forward acts of kindness, like the one that was done for me.
