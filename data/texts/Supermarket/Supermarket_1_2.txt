I was shopping at my local supermarket as I have done for years. On that particular day I had about 2 weeks worth of groceries in my cart. I wait in line and get to get to the register. As I am about to pay I reach into my back right pocket to get the cash I had put there earlier. My pocket was empty! I then started to get nervous. I gave the cashier a confused look.  She told me to go ask the courtesy counter. I laugh and say "it was cash who would turn in cash?" 

I decide theres no harm in asking so I do so anyways. I ask "by any chance has anyone turned in cash?" She replies "As a matter of fact yes someone has."  My face then lit up. "How much shes asks. I say "200$ in 20s." She gives me the money and then I ask who it was because I want to thank them. She points to a 10 year old on the other side of the room. I eagerly walk over and hug the mother. The mother says don't hug me it was all my daughter thank her. I will now partake in random acts of kindness as much as I can!
