I was shopping at my local grocery store and had done about 2 weeks worth of shopping. I went up to the register to pay and reached into my back right pocket for the money, when I noticed it wasn't there. I began to worry, because I knew I had put the money from my wallet into my back right pocket. I looked at the cashier, unsure of what to do. I thought immediately of the money in my wallet in my car which was supposed to go towards this month's rent. The cashier suggested I go to the front desk and ask if anyone had turned in any money. I laughed. "But it was cash, no one would have turned that in!"

	I decided there was no harm in checking, so I went up to a woman behind the counter and asked "By any chance, did anyone turn in any money in cash?" "How much?" she replied. My face then lit up. "Two hundred in the form of twenty-dollar bills." "Actually, someone did!" She gave me my money. "Who was it?" I asked. "I want to thank them." The woman pointed to a 10-year old girl behind me. "She did." I went up to the mother and gave her a big hug. "Actually, it was my daughter," she said. I was so grateful to the little girl, and now I pay that act of kindness forward whenever I can.
