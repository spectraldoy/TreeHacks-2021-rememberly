I was shopping at my local supermarket as I have for years. This time I had done about two weeks worth of shopping, and I went to get in line to pay for it. When I got to the front, I reached into my back pocket to get the money, and noticed it wasn't there. I gave the cashier a confused look, not knowing what to do. I thought about my pocketbook in the car, with the money intended to pay this month's rent. The cashier told me to check with the courtesy counter. I laughed "But it was cash, no one would turn that in!"

I decided there was no harm in checking, so I went up to the woman behind the counter and said "I have to ask, did anyone turn in any cash?" "How much?" she replied. I lit up. "$200 in the form of twenty dollar bills." "Actually yes, someone did!" She replied. "Who are they? I want to thank them," I said. She pointed to a 10-year-old girl. I went over and hugged the mother, who said, "Actually it was my daughter." I gave the girl a big hug. I was almost in tears. I decided from that moment on to pay that act of kindness forward.
