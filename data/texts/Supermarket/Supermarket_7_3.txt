A woman was at her local supermarket shopping like she had done many times. She was at the register about to pay for her groceries, when she reached into her back pocket and noticed her money was gone. She thought back to her checkbook in her car but that money was for her rent. She explained everything to the cashier and the cashier told her to ask guest services. The woman laughed at the thought of anyone turning in cash. She figured she might as well go check. The woman walked over to guest services and asked if anyone had turned in cash. The woman behind the desk asked how much, and the woman became hopeful, as if her money might be there. The woman replied saying $200 in twenties, and the woman at guest services handed over her cash. The woman asked who turned it in, because she wanted to thank them, and the woman behind the counter pointed to a woman and her daughter. The woman went up to the other woman and hugged her, but the mother explained that it was actually her daughter who turned the money in. The woman thanked the daughter and vowed to always join in on these random acts of kindness if possible.
