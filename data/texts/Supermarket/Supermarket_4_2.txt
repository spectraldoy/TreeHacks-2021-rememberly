I was shopping at my local grocery store, as I normally have for years. This time in particular, I was buying two weeks worth of groceries. At the cashier, I reached into my back pocket to pay. I realized there was no cash there. I looked behind me to the people in line. I started to get nervous. I immediately thought about my pocketbook, which I had left in my car, but I was sure I had put the money in my back pocket. I looked at the cashier, not knowing what to do. I told her about my situation and she told me to check the courtesy counter. I laughed and said, "But it was cash! Nobody would turn that in."



But I decided there was no harm in checking. I went over to the courtesy counter and asked, "Do you know if anyone turned in some cash?" she asked, "How much?" My face lit up, and I said "$200 worth in $20 bills." She said, "Why yes! Someone did!" I said, "Who?" She pointed at a little girl, about 10 years old. I went over to her mom and hugged her. She said, "It wasn't me! It was my daughter!" I was so happy I was almost in tears. It was that day that I decided to pay this act of kindness forward every chance I get.
