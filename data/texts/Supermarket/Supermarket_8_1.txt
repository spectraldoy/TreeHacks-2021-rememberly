I was shopping in a local supermarket that was a usual of mine. After I had shopped for about two weeks of groceries I reached into my back right pocket for the money to the pay. I realized with shock that there was no money there. Beginning to feel nervous, I remembered the checkbook that was in the car and I swore that I had put the money in my back right pocket. There was a line behind me and thinking about the money in the car that was supposed to go to rent I felt more nervous. The cashier said to me to check the courtesy counter. I laughed, and said it was cash, who would turn that in? As I asked the clerk at the courtesy counter if anyone had left a large amount of cash he asked me how much. My face lit up and said two-hundred dollars in twenty bills. The clerk said sure enough yes someone did turn that in. I was overjoyed and asked who as I wanted to thank them in person. The clerk said it was a ten-year old girl standing over there. I went over to her mom and hugged her, being so thankful. The mom said it wasn't me that did it, it was her daughter. From that moment forward I decided to pay it forward with the kindness that I receive with other acts of kindness.
