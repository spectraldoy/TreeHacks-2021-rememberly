I went to my local supermarket that I had shopped at  for years. One particular day, I had done about 2 weeks' worth of shopping and headed for the checkout counter. I reached into my back right pocket and discovered the money wasn't there. I was sure I had put the money  from my pocket book into my back pocket. I was nervous. There were other people in line behind me and I considered using the money in my car for rent. I looked at the cashier with a confused look. She suggested going to the courtesy counter to see if anyone turned it in. I found this unlikely considering it was cash. I approached the woman behind the counter and asked if anyone turned in some cash. She asked how much. My face lit up. I said $200 in twenty dollar bills. She said yes. I wanted to thank the person that turned it in. The woman pointed to a 10 year old girl. I went over and hugged the mother. The mother explained it was her 10 year old daughter that turned it in. I was so thankfully. I decided in that moment to pay the act of kindness forward any chance I got.
