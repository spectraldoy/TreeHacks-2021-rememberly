I was shopping at my local supermarket as I had done for years. One particular day, I was buying two-weeks worth of groceries. I walked over to the cashier and as I was getting ready to pay, I reached into my back pocket and my money was not in there. I was sure that I had put the cash in my back right pocket. I started to get nervous. There were people behind me in line and I thought to my pocketbook in the car that had my money for rent. The cashier suggested I go to the courtesy counter. I laughed and said, "But it was cash. Who would turn that in?"

I thought there was no harm in checking the courtesy counter. I walked up and asked if anyone had turned in cash. The woman said, "How much?" My face lit up. "$200 in twenties" I replied. The woman handed it over to me. I was so eternally grateful. "Who turned it in?" I asked. "I want to thank them." The woman behind the counter pointed at a ten year old girl. I went up to the mom and gave her a huge hug. The mom said that it was her daughter who turned the money in. I vowed in that moment to always perform these acts of kindness.
