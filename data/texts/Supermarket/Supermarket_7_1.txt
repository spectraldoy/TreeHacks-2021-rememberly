A woman went to the grocery store that she had shopped at for years. When she was in line to pay for her groceries, she reached into her back pocket and noticed that he cash was gone. She knew she left her pocketbook in the car and put her cash in her back right pocket. She was thinking about her money in the car that was for this week's rent. She talked to the cashier, who suggested she go check the curtousey counter. She didn't think anyone would turn in cash, but figured there was no harm in checking. She walked up to the counter and asked by chance if anyone had turned in cash. The woman at the counter asked how much. The woman smiled and said $200 in twenties. The woman behind the counter said yes and handed over the cash. The woman was eternally grateful and asked who had turned in the money because she wanted to thank them. The woman at the counter pointed to a ten year old girl. The woman ran up to the mom and hugged her to thank her. The mom said that it was actually her daughter who turned in the money. The woman thanked the mom and her daughter for turning in the money. The woman was so thankful for this act of kindness and vowed to always be kind whenever possible.
