One day, I went shopping the super market like I always did. I had gotten about 2 weeks' worth of groceries and I was in line at the checkout. As I got to the front of the line, I reached towards my back pocket, where I had put the money for groceries. I noticed that it was empty, and I got very nervous, thinking about the pocket book that was in the car. The money in the car was meant to pay this month's rent. I smiled at the cashier nervously, and she suggested I go to the courtesy counter. "It was cash, though. Who would have turned that in?" 



I figured I would give it a try so I walked up to the courtesy counter with no hope. "Has anyone turned in cash to this counter?" The woman responded, "How much?" My eyes widened as I gained hope that it might have been returned. "$200 in twenties." The woman responded, "Actually, yes." "Who turned it in? I want to thank them!" The woman pointed at a young girl. I went up to the mother and hugged her. "It was my daughter." From that point on, I promised that if I had the chance I would pass the kindness on.
