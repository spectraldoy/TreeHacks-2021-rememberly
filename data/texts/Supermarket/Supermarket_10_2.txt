I was shopping at my local supermarket as I had for years.  This particular trip I was shopping for 2 week's worth of groceries.  I got in line and reached for the money in my back pocket.  However, to my shock there was nothing in my pocket.  I looked up at the cashier in surprise as I didn't know what to do.  I remembered that I had left my pocketbook in the car.  There were people behind me and I thought about the money I had left in the car meant to be used to pay that month's rent.  The cashier told me to check with the courtesy counter.   I said "But it was in cash! Nobody turns in cash!"



I went up to the courtesy counter and asked if anyone had turned in any money.  The clerk replied "How much?"  I excitedly answered "It was $200 in 20 dollar denominations".  She said happily answered "Someone did turn in exactly that amount".  I was so happy I couldn't believe it.  I asked "Who had turned it in?"  The clerk pointed to a 10 year old girl.  I went up to the mother and hugged her and she replied "It wasn't me, it was my daughter."  From that day on I promised that I would pay it forward.
