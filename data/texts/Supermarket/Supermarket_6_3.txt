Every day my cat disappears from the house around noon. One day she was sitting by the pool, then came to the glass door and started sctatching on it. That means she's hungry. It was about noon and I saw my cat take off down the street so I decided to follow her. She went down the street and around the corner. After a while I realized where she was going. There was a fishers market behind the shooping center. As I got closer, I saw the owner throw away a big bag of garbage, the sent out a clear smaller bag on the ground. Within seconds, a swarm of cats came out to pounce on the bag of fish heads. The owner explains to me that everyday around noon, he sets out fish heads for the cats. I know understood where my cat goes every day, and we walk back home together.
