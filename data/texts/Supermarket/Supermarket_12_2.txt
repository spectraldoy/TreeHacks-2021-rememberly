I was shopping at my local supermarket as I have normally for years. I had just done about 2 weeks' worth of shopping and was headed to the register to pay. I reached in my back pocket to pay and realized my money wasn't there. I started to get nervous. I knew my pocket book was in the car and I was so sure I'd put the money in my right back pocket. I looked at the casher, confused, unsure of what to do. There were people behind me in line. I immediately thought about how the money I left in the car was supposed to pay for this month's rent. The cashier told me to speak to the courtesy counter. I laughed and said, "But why? It's cash, no one would hand that in!"



	I knew there was no harm in checking so I went up to the woman behind the counter and asked, "Did anyone turn in cash, by chance?" She asked, "How much cash?"  My entire face lit up. "$200 in the form of twenty dollar bills." I said. She said," Why yes, someone did!" I was so happy! "Who? I would love to thank them properly." The cashier pointed to a little 10 year old girl and I walked over to the mother and hugged her. The mother, however, said, "I didn't turn it in, my daughter did." I vowed to return that act of kindness.
