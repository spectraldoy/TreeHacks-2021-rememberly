There was a girl grocery shopping. She was getting 2 weeks worth of groceries at her local grocery store. She got in line and when she got to the register she reached into her back pocket and realized that she had lost her money. The money in the car in her pocket book was for her rent. The cashier told her to check the courtesy counter. The girl laughed and said who would turn in cash but checked anyways. The lady at the counter said actually yes someone did, how much did you lose? The girl said $200 and the lady said yes and gave the money to her. The girl asked the lady who turned it in and she pointed to a women in the corner. The girl went over to thank the women and she said it was actually her daughter. The girl decided she would do random acts of kindness whenever she could.
