I was shopping in my local supermarket as I had done for years. One particular day, I had gotten about 2 weeks' worth of groceries and headed to the register to pay. I reached into my back left pocket to get my money, only to discover it was not there. I began to get nervous and gave a confused look to the cashier. I knew I had left my pocketbook in my car and brought the money in using my back left pocket. Looking at the people behind me in line, I thought of the money sitting in my car intended for this month's rent. The cashier recommended I check the courtesy counter to see if anyone had turned in the money. I laughed and said, "But it was cash! Who would turn that in?" 



Nevertheless, I decided it could not hurt to check. I approached the counter and spoke to the woman working it, "I have to ask, did anyone turn in any money today?" She replied, "How much?" My face lit up, "$200 in twenty dollar bills." "Actually, someone did!" she replied, as she handed me my money. I was so excited, "Who turned this in?" I asked, "I have to thank them." "She did," the woman replied, pointing to a nearby woman and her daughter.
