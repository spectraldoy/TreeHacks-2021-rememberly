I was grocery shopping at the local store as I had done for years. One particular day, I had done about 2 weeks' worth of shopping when I got in line at the cash register. I reached into my back right pocket for money when I realized it was empty. I started to get nervous. I looked at the cashier confused. I was looking back at the people on the line behind me and I thought about the rent money I had in my car. I know my pocketbook was in the car but I know I had taken out the money and put it in my pocket. The cashier said to check with the courtesy counter. I laughed and said "It was cash! There's no way anyone is going to turn that in."

	I went to the courtesy counter and asked "Did someone happen to turn in cash by any chance?" The woman behind the counter asked how much. My face lit up. "$200 in $20 bills." "Actually someone did!" "Who was it? I would like to thank them." The woman behind the counter pointed to a 10 year old girl and her mother. I went over to thank them and gave the mother a hug. I was so happy I was almost in tears. The mother said "It actually wasn't me, it was my daughter!" From that moment on I decided to repay that act of kindness every opportunity I had.
