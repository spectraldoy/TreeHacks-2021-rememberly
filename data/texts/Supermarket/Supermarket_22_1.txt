The woman was shopping at the grocery store. She had done about 2 weeks worth of grocery shopping and was about to pay at the cashier counter. She reached into her back right pocket but nothing was there. She was certain she had placed her money for groceries into her back right pocket. She left her pocket book in the car. The only other money she had in the car was to pay her rent for the month. She didn't know what to do. The cashier recommended she go to the courtesy counter to see if anyone had turned in the cash she lost. The woman said it was unlikely someone would turn it in because it was cash. 



She ended up going to the courtesy counter because she decided it was worth it to check. She asked the woman at the counter if anyone had turned in cash. The woman asked "How much?". She responded that she had lost $200 in cash in the form of $20 bills. The woman at the counter said someone had turned it in. The shopper was relieved and surprised. She asked who turned in the cash and the worker pointed towards a 10 year old girl. The shopper went over and hugged the girl's mother who said "It wasn't me. It was my daughter." The woman thanked them and decided that since they were so kind she would pay it forward and act similarly in the future.
