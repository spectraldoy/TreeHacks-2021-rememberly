I was at my regular super market that I had shopped at for years. I got 2 weeks worth of groceries and headed for the checkout counter. I reached into my back pocket and discover the money wasn't there. I panicked. I was sure I had put the money in my back pocket. I had my pocket book in the car and debated on using the money for rent to pay for my groceries. The woman at the counter suggested I go to the courtesy counter to see if anyone turned in the money. I though this was very unlikely but went anyways. The clerk asked how much I had lost. I explained $200 in 20 dollar bills. To my surprise the clerk said " yes someone turned that in". I was so happy and wanted to thank the person that had turned it in. the clerk pointed to a woman. I went over and hugged her and told her thank you but the mother explained it was her 10 year old daughter. I will now make it a point to return the act of kindness.
