I was shopping in my local supermarket, as I had usually done for years. I had just gotten about two weeks worth of groceries and was heading to the register to check out. I reached into my back- left pocket to get the money to pay for the groceries, when I realized my wallet wasn't there. I was sure I had put the two- hundred dollars in my back left pocket, and thought of the money I had left in the car to pay for rent and things this month. I looked anxiously at the cashier, who suggested I go to customer services. "Yeah right," I thought to myself, "who would hand in cash?"

	

	Still, I thought it couldn't hurt and went to the customer service counter. "Excuse me, but did anyone happen to hand in cash today?" I asked. "Why yes, actually they did. What did it look like?" The woman asked. My face just lit up then! "It was two hundred dollars in twenty dollar bills." The woman handed me the cash, and I looked around. "Who was it that handed it in? I'd like to thank them!" She pointed to a little girl about ten years old and I walked over to them. I hugged the girl's mother. "Thank you so much!" "Actually, it was my daughter who handed it in," she said. I promised that day I would always do my duty and pay forward that act of kindness.
