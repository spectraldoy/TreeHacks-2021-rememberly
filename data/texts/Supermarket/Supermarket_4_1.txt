I was grocery shopping at my local grocery store, as I have every week for years. This time in particular, I was shopping for two week's worth of groceries. As I walked up to the cashier, I reached into my back pocket to grab my cash. Suddenly, I panicked, as I realized the cash was not there. I looked at the cashier confused, like I did not know what to do. I thought about my pocketbook, which was in my car, that had cash inside it. But then I realized that cash was meant to pay my rent for next month. I told her what happened and she said to ask the desk, as someone could have turned it in. I looked to her and said, nobody would turn this in! It was cash! But there was no harm in asking. Slowly, I walked over to the desk and asked if anyone had turned in a wad of cash. They asked how much, and I said $200. They said, why yes! Someone did turn in 200 dollars! I asked who, and she pointed over at a girl and her mom. The mom said it was not me, it was my daughter! I gave her a big hug. It was then that I realized that I would try to do a random act of kindness for people now on.
