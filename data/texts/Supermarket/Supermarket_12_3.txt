One day a lady went grocery shopping. She'd finished her grocery shopping and was standing in line waiting to check out when she reached into her back pocket and realized her money wasn't where she'd placed it. She realized she was holding up the line of people behind her but she had no idea what to do. She remembered bringing her wallet into the car that morning and had stuck the money she'd needed for grocery shopping in her back pocket of her jeans. The remaining money in the wallet was to pay for that month's rent. She looked at the cashier, bewildered. The cashier suggested that the lady visit the Customer's Corner and see if anyone had turned in some missing money. The lady was quite skeptical because she didn't believe anyone would be kind enough to turn in money they'd found.

	

	However, when she got to the Customer's Corner, she was in for a pleasant surprise. The worker behind the desk asked her how much she was missing. When the lady told her the exact amount, the worker said that someone had actually turned in the cash. The lady was ecstatic and couldn't believe her luck. She asked the store worker who the person was so she could properly thank them. The worker pointed to a woman in the store. The lady went over to the woman and gave her a big head, but the woman told her that it wasn't her doing, but rather, her young daughter's. 

	
The lady thanked the daughter and from that day on vowed to treat others with the same kindness this little girl had treated her with.
