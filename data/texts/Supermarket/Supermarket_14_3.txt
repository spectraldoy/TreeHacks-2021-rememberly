The main character was shopping at the local supermarket one day and had gathered enough groceries for 2 weeks. When they went to check out however, they discovered that they didn't have any money in their back right pocket. They were sure that they had put their money in the pocket, and they started to worry that they had lost the money and would have to use the rent money they had left in the car. However, the cashier suggested the person to ask the service desk for help and the main character thought "why not?" by that point. 

		When the main character asked the woman behind the help desk if anyone had turned in any money, she replied that someone did and asked them how much they had misplaced. After confirming that the $200 (in twenty dollar bills) belonged to the main character and had been returned, the person asked who had turned the money in because they didn't believe anyone would turn in that much cash. The service woman explained that a young girl had turned it in and pointed her out nearby. The main character hugged the girl's mother and thanked her, but the mother insisted that it was all her daughter's help. The narrator then swore to do their best to help others from that day on.
