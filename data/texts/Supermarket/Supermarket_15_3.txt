A woman was in her local market, purchasing her goods just like any other shopper. Like some of those, she was in a haste. When she went to check out, she realized she was missing the $200 in cash she had carried for her purchase. She thought of her checkbook in her car, but then she thought about the bills she had to pay with those. Desperately, she told the cashier her dilemma. Sympathetic, the check-out girl pointed her to the help desk.

	

	"Who would return such a large fund?" she thought, but went through with the process all the same. The help desk lady surprised her by confirming someone had turned in that sum, pointing out a woman. The shopper thanked the woman for her kindness. The woman replied, "It wasn't me, it was my daughter."
