I was shopping at my local grocery store as I always do.  I had just shopped for about two weeks worth of groceries, when I reached into my right pocket to grab the money but it wasn't there. I got nervous. I remembered the pocket book I left in the car and knew that I had put my money in my pocket.  I thought about the rest of the money which was for my month's rent.   The cash register lady told me to ask the courtesy counter.  I laughed and said "its money, who would turn that in?"  

	It was worth a shot, so I went over to the courtesy counter and asked if anybody had turned in any money.  The lady replied, "yes, actually somebody has! How much?"  I got so excited, I had $200 in the form of twenty dollar bills. I asked the women, "who turned in the money? I want to thank them!" She pointed to a 10 year old girl.  I ran over to the mom and hug her.  The mom pointed to the little girl and said, "it was all her."  I was so excited that I was almost in tears.  I decided from that moment on, that I would always pay forward any acts of kindness.
