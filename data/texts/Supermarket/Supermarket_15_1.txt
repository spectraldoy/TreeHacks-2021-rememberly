One day I was at my local grocery store where I had shopped normally for years. I had about two weeks' worth of groceries. When I reached into my back pocket to pay, there was no money. I panicked. My checkbook was in the car, but the cash in there was for rent. I gave the cashier a confused look. There were people on the line and I thought I had the money in my pocket. "It was cash," I laughed and thought. "Who would turn that in?"



I turned to the woman behind me in line and said, "I have to ask. Did somebody find $200 in $20's?" "Yes," she responded. "Who?" I asked. "My ten-year old daughter." I was so relieved in that moment that I decided to pay forward any act of kindness.
