One day I was shopping at my local supermarket as I had been doing for years. After collecting about two weeks worth of groceries, I reached in my right back pocket to retrieve the cash that I had recently received from my last paycheck. I began to get nervous after discovering that the cash was no longer there, and thought about the cash that was left behind in my car to pay this month's rent. I was convinced that I had removed the money from my pocket book earlier back in my car.



I anxiously looked at the clerk in confusion, as a line of customers began forming behind me. The cashier encouraged me to inquire at the courtesy desk, but I laughed and exclaimed that "no one would turn in cash!" However, I decided that it wouldn't hurt to check, and asked if any cash had been recently turned in by fellow shoppers today. The clerk asked how much and then confirmed that a young girl (around age 10) had turned in my $200 in 20-dollar bills while grocery shopping with her mother. I was delighted and hugged the girl beside her mother. From that point onward, I resolved to pay forward this act of kindness during every opportunity I received.
