I was shopping at my local supermarket like I always had. One particular day, I had gotten about 2 weeks' worth of groceries. I got up to the front of the line and reached to my back pocket and found it to be empty. I thought about the pocket book out in my car, and I was sure I put the money in my back pocket. I saw the line of people behind me and smiled nervously at the cashier.  I thought about the money in my car that was meant to pay this month's rent. She suggested I check with the courtesy counter. I laughed and said, "But it was cash, who would've turned that in?" 



I thought it couldn't hurt to check so I went up to the courtesy counter and asked, "did anyone happen to turn in any cash?" The woman asked, "How much?" I grinned, saying "$200 in twenty dollar bills." She said, "Actually yes, someone did!" I asked, " who did this? I want to thank them." The woman pointed at a young girl, about 10 years old. I went up to her mother and hugged her. The mother said, "It wasn't me, it was my daughter." I vowed from that moment on that I would pass on this act of kindness whenever I had the chance.
