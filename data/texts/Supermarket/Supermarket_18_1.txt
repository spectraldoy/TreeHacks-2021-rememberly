I was doing my shopping at the local grocery store as I had done for years. I had done about 2 weeks'  worth of shopping when I got in line at the register. I reached into my back right pocket to pay for the groceries when I realized that there was no money there. I was getting nervous. There were people on the line behind me and I looked at the cashier. I knew my pocketbook was in the car and I had taken out the money and put it in my pocket. There was also money for rent there. The cashier suggested I ask at the courtesy counter. I thought "There's no way anyone turned it inâ€¦ it was cash!" But, I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask. I went up to the courtesy counter and asked "By any chance did someone turn in cash?" The woman behind the counter asked "How much?" and my face lit up. I responded "$200 in $20 bills." She said "As a matter of fact someone did." I wanted to thank whoever did that so I asked who turned it in. The woman behind the counter pointed to a woman over my shoulder. I was so happy I was in tears. I went up to the woman and hugged her. She informed me it was actually her daughter who returned the money. From that moment on I decided to pay forward every act of kindness.
