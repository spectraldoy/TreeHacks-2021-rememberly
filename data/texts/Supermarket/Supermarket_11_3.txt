A woman was shopping at her favorite supermarket and on line waiting to pay when she realized she did not have her wallet on her. She remembered that she put it in her back right pocket. As the cashier looked at her, she became nervous and asked if anyone had returned a wallet. The cashier told her to check with customer service. As she walked over to the service counter she thought to herself that no one would return a wallet with $200 cash inside of it. When she asked the woman at the service counter if anyone had returned a wallet the woman said "yes, she did" and pointed to a little girl that was standing next to her mother. The woman was thrilled and hugged the mother thanking her. The mother told her that the little girl was the one responsible for handing it back and the woman thanked her.
