The woman was shopping at the local grocery store where she had been going for many years. She was at the checkout counter, ready to pay for her groceries, when she reached into her back right pocket and found there was no money. She looked at the cashier confused and became nervous. She had no money to pay. She had left her pocket book in the car but the only remaining money in there was meant to pay her rent for the month. The cashier suggested the woman go to the courtesy counter to see if someone turned in her lost money. The woman said "It was cash and nobody would turn that in!"



Regardless, the woman decided it was worth it to go to the courtesy counter and check with the woman working there. She asked if anyone had turned in cash. The woman at the counter asked "How much?" and she replied "$200 in the form of $20 bills". The worker told her someone did turn it in. When the shopper asked who the worker pointed to a ten year-old girl. The shopper went up to the girl's mother to hug and thank her. She said "It wasn't me. It was my daughter". The woman was relieved and decided to pay it forward with acts of kindness in these moments in the future.
