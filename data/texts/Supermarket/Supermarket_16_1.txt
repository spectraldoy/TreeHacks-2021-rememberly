One day I was shopping at my local supermarket and had just gathered about 2 weeks worth of groceries. At the check-out counter, I reached into my right back pocket to retrieve the money I had received from my last paycheck. I began to get nervous, after discovering that the money was gone, and began to think about the cash I had left behind in the car to pay this month's rent. I was positive I had removed the money from my pocket book back in the car.



A line of customers was forming, and I look at the clerk in confusion, who encouraged me to visit the courtesy desk to inquire about the lost cash. Despite my assumption that no one would have turned in cash, I visited the courtesy desk and – much to my surprise – a young girl approximately 10 years old had turned in my $200 in cash, paid in 20 dollar bills. I hugged the girl, who was shopping with her mother, and vowed to pay this kindness forward in the future.
