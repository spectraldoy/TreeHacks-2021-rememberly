I was shopping at my favorite local supermarket. I had gathered about two weeks' worth of food and went to the counter to pay for my groceries. I was in line and put my hand to my back right pocket to pull out the money. But, the money was not there. I started to get nervous. I thought of my pocket book I had left in the car and knew I had put the money for food in my back right pocket. I look at the cashier confused, not sure what to do. There was a whole line of people behind me. I thought of my pocket book in the car with the money in there that was supposed to be used for this month's rent. The cashier suggested I speak with the courtesy counter. I said, "But, it's money no one would turn that in!"

	I decided there was no harm in asking. I went to the counter and asked the woman behind it, "Has anyone turned in money?" The woman said, "How much". My face lit up. "$200 in the form of 20 dollar bills". The woman said, "Why yes, someone did". I was so excited. I said, "Who was it I want to thank them". And she pointed to a 10 year old girl. I went over to the mom and hugged her. She said, "it wasn't me, it was my daughter". Then I thanked her. I decided then that I would pay forward this act of kindness whenever I could.
