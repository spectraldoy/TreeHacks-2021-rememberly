One day I was shopping in my local supermarket, as I had usually done for years. I had gotten my groceries and went to the cashier. I reached into my back right pocket to get the money to pay. I realized it wasn't there. I looked at the cashier, not sure what to do. I started to get nervous. I had left my pocketbook in the car, but I was sure that I had put the money in my back right pocket. I realized the money I had left in the car was supposed to be used for rent that month. The cashier suggested I go to the courtesy counter. "But it was cash! Who would turn that in?"



Still, I figured it couldn't hurt. "Did anyone by chance hand in cash?" I asked. "How much?" The worker asked. My face lit up. "Two hundred dollars in the form of twenty dollar bills," I replied. "Why yes, they did!" She handed me the money. "Who was it?" I asked. She pointed to a ten year old girl. I went over and hugged the mother. "Actually," she said, "it was my daughter not me." I was so happy I was almost in tears. I decided in those moments to do my duty to pay forward that act of kindness every chance I had.
