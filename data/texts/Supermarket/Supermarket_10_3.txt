One Saturday I was out grocery shopping as I usually do.  I was in line waiting to pay for my groceries.  When the time came to pay I reached into my back pocket and was shocked.  The money wasn't there.  I reached into my other pocket and felt nothing neither either.  I looked at the cashier in surprise and told her I had lost my money.  She told me to ask the clerk at the front desk and I replied that "No one would ever turn in $200 dollars!"  I walked to the front desk and asked the clerk if anyone had turned in any money.  She asked "How much?"  Excitedly I told her it was $200 dollars all in $20s.  She replied that the same amount had been turned in by that little girl over there.  I went over to the mother and hugged her "It was my daughter who turned it in."  From that day on I had more faith in humanity and promised to pay it forward.
