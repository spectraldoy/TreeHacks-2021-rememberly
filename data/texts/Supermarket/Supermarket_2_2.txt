I was shopping at my local supermarket as I normally have for years. One particular day, I had done about two weeks' worth of shopping and went to the counter to pay for my groceries. I reached into my back right pocket to get the money to pay and there was no money in there. I started to get nervous. I knew my pocket book was in the car and that I put the money in my back right pocket. I look at cashier with a confused look, not knowing what to do. There were people on the line behind me. I thought of my pocket book in the car with my money in it that was supposed to be used to pay this month's rent. The cashier suggested I speak with the courtesy counter. I said, "But it was money, no one would turn that in!"

	I decided there was no harm in asking. I walked up to the women behind the counter and asked, "has anyone turned in any money?" She said, "how much?" Then my face lit up. "$200 in the form of 20-dollar bills". She said, "Actually, yes, someone has!" I was so surprised! I asked, "Who? I want to thank them". She pointed to a 10-year old girl. I walked over to the mom and hugged her. She said, "it wasn't me, it was my daughter". I was so happy, I was in tears. I decided in those moments that I would pay back that act of kindness whenever I could.
