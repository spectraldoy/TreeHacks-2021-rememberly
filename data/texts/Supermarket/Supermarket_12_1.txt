I was shopping at my local supermarket as I had for years. One day in particular, I had done about 2 weeks worth of shopping and was headed to pay for the groceries. I reached in my back pocket but found nothing there. I got nervous because my pocket book was in the car and I was certain I'd put the money in my right back pocket. I looked at the cashier, confused, not knowing what to do. There was a line of people behind me and all I could think of was the money in the car I'd planned to pay this month's rent with. The cashier suggested I go to the help center.



I went, not thinking to find my money, because no one would give back money.  But I thought it wouldn't hurt to try. I asked,"Has someone turned in cash recently?" The lady replied, "How much?" I immediately perked up! "$200 in the form of $20 bills," I said. "Why, yes! Someone just turned it in." I was so overjoyed, I asked to know who I owed my gratitude to. The lady pointed at a mother and daughter and I immediately went over to hug the mother. She replied, "I didn't find it. My daughter did." From that day, I vowed to always return that act of kindness.
