Paul Smith had always wanted to fly. Unfortunately, he was colorblind, which made being a pilot an unlikely future. Most people might just give up under such circumstances, but Paul Smith was not most people. 



One fine day, in the backyard of his San Fernando valley house, Paul constructed a craft out of a lawn chair and forty odd weather balloons. Armed only with a pellet gun, a cooler full of sandwiches, and a radio he released the cord tethering him to his vehicle. He would hover about fifteen feet in the air, have a nice little picnic, then shoot a couple of the balloons and float right back down to the ground just as easy as can be. The problem was the Paul was not so good with physics. He floated thousands of feet in the air. He was too scared to shoot any of the balloons, for fear that he might tip over. He eventually floated over to the Long Beach Airport, but not before getting tangled up in some wires and cutting the power to the greater Long Beach area. It seems the authorities did not take too kindly to his flying over restricted airspace.
