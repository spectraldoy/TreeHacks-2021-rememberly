Larry Walters wished he could fly.  However, Larry had poor eyesight which meant he could not be a pilot.  This didn't stop Larry though.  One fine day he put together a lawn chair, a seat belt, and 40 weather balloons.  He stocked up a cooler with some sandwiches and a gun so that he could descend by shooting a balloon.  Larry unfortunately was not good at physics and the craft ascend 15,000 feet.  He didn't date shoot any of the balloons afraid that the chair would tip over.



Eventually Larry floated into the Long Beach Airport airspace.  Now take a moment to imagine what this must've looked like to the people arriving onto the tarmac waiting to deplane, a man in a floating lawn chair with a gun.  Eventually Larry did descend and it goes without saying that he was arrested for violating FAA airspace.  When asked why he did it Larry responded "A man's gotta do something."
