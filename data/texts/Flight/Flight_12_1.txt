Larry Walters had a dream that he could fly. The problem was, Larry's vision was poor, so he was unfit to be a pilot. Many people, faced with similar issues, might let go of their dream.

	But, Larry Walters was not most people. On a sunny summer day in 1982, in his modest backyard in San Pedro, Larry boarded a makeshift plane. It consisted of a lawn chair, seat belt, and about 40 something balloons. He had a pellet gun, CB radio, and cooler full of sandwiches, and he released the line from his Jeep, and rose 30 feet in the air. He was having a little picnic. He had planned to just shoot out a few balloons and float back to earth. 

	However, Larry was not good at physics. The moment he released the tether, he flew about 15,000 feet in the air. He didn't shoot the balloons because otherwise the chair would tip. Larry drifted Long Beach airport and disrupted traffic. He wondered what he must look like to others: a man in a lawn chair with a gun. 

	He finally landed and once he did he was immediately arrested for flying into restricted airspace. He was all over the papers. One reporter asked him why he did and Larry responded, "A man can't just sit around."
