Larry Walters had a dream that he could fly. The problem was that Larry's vision was poor, thus making him ill-suited to become a pilot. Most people, when faced with these challenges,  might give up. Larry Walters was not most people. On one sunny summer day in 1982, in his modest backyard in San Pedro, Larry Walters boarded a makeshift aircraft comprised of a lawn chair, a seatbelt, and 30 odd weather balloons. Armed with a bb gun, a CB radio, and a cooler of sandwiches, Larry's plan was to cut the tether that tied him to his Jeep, rise 30 feet in the air, and have himself a little picnic. He would then shoot a few of the weather balloons and float gently back to earth. But Larry was not so good at physics, and when he cut the tether, he floated 15,000 feet in the air. Some reports say that Larry didn't dare shoot any of the weather balloons, for fear that the chair would tip. Soon he drifted into the Laguna Beach airport traffic way and caused a problem with air traffic. It must have looked odd to onlookersâ€”a man floating 3 miles in the air in an armchair. When Larry made it back to the ground he was promptly arrested. Seems like the police didn't appreciate him violating FAA regulations. Some reporters asked him why he'd do such a thing. His response? "A man can't just sit around."
