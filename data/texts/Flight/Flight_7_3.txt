A man's dream was to be a pilot, but because of his vision, he was not eligible to fly. Most people would just give up this dream, but he was not most people. One sunny day in his backyard, he built a contraption of a lawn chair tied with balloons to his jeep. He made himself a picnic and wanted to spend the day outside. He sat in the chair and untied some ropes and then soared three feet into the air. He had a pleasant picnic, and when he was ready to come down, he shot a few of the balloons. Instead of floating down like he had planned, the man soared thirty thousand feet into the sky. He was afraid to shoot a few more of the balloons, in case he would raise in height even further. He soared all the way near the airport, and actually interrupted the air traffic. Imagine the people on the planes having to wait to land because a man in a lawn chair was in the sky and invading air space. He was able to safely land at the airport after getting stuck in a telephone wire and cutting off power to the whole city. He ended up getting arrested for invading air space and news crews heard about the story. One of the newscasters asked why in the world he would do this, and while the man was getting arrested, he overheard this and said "A man can't just sit around"
