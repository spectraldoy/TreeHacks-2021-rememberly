Larry Walters had a dream of flying. The problem was that Larry Walters had poor vision which made him ill-suited to be a pilot. Most people would find new dreams in this situation but Larry did not. He created a makeshift aircraft at his home in San Pedro using a lawn chair and some forty odd weather balloons. He released the tether holding his creation to his jeep and began to elevate in the air. 



The problem was that Larry was not very precise in his physics and his makeshift aircraft rose over 11,000 feet into the air. He planned to shoot balloons with his guns to come down but was now too afraid his chair might tip. He drifted into the restricted airspace over Long Beach airport and disrupted air traffic. Pilots waiting to land must have been very surprised to see a man floating with balloons in his lawn chair with a gun strapped to his back. Eventually, Larry Walters did come to the ground after becoming tangles in power lines which caused an outage in the entire area. The FAA then arrested him for his stunt. When asked by reporters why he did this, Larry Walters responded, "a man can't just sit around".
