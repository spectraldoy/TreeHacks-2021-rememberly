Larry walter's had a dream that he could fly. Though Larry had poor vision, which made him ill suited to be a pilot. Most people would give up on this dream if faced with similar limitations. However, larry wasn't most people. One sunny summer day in 1982 while in his san pedro backyard he decided to make a makeshift aircraft. It consisted of a lawn chair, a seatbelt, and 40 odd weather balloons. He was armed with a pellet gun, a CB radio, and a cooler of sandwiches. He tethered to his jeep and floated 40 feet in the air. Turns out his physics weren't very good and he was 15,000 feet in the air. He ended up drifting into the approach side of the long beach airport. He disrupted air traffic. Once he finally came down he got tangled into some power lines and cut off power for all of long beach. The FAA took umbrage with what he had done and he was arrested. A few crack reporters heard and asked why he did it. He replied, "a man can't just sit around."
