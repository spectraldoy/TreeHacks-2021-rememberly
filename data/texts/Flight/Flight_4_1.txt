Once, there was a guy named Larry. Larry had a dream that he could fly, but he was not suited to be a pilot. Most guys with Larry's suit would just give up, but Larry wouldn't do that.



He tied a lawn chair with 40 balloons and brought sandwiches and a gun. He broke the tether between him and his Jeep, and he figured that he would float to about 30 feet in the air, have a picnic, and then shoot the balloons until he would land safely on the ground.



However, Larry was not very good at physics. Before he knew it, he was 15,000 feet in the air. He didn't dare shoot any balloons for fear the chair would flip over. He then rose to airplane level and disrupted air space. Imagine, what a sight! A guy in a lawn chair and balloons with a gun 3 miles high in the air! 



He did, eventually, make it back down safely. But he got tangled in some power cords and knocked out power for his Long Island neighborhood. He then got arrested, as the FAA had a problem with him being in restricted airspace. When journalists asked why he did it, he answered, "A man can't just sit around!"
