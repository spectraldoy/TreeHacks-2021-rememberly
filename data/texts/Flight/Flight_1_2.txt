Larry Walters had a dream he could fly. The problem was he had poor eyesight. Being illsuited to be a pilot most people would give up that dream. Not larry however. 

One day at his house in San Pedro Larry decided to make a makeshift air craft. His vessel consisted of 40 odd weather balloons tied to a lawn chair, a CB radio, a cooler full of sandwiches and a pellet gun. He released the tether holding his craft to his jeep and drifted 30 feet into the air. His plan was to shoot out some balloons and gently drift back to earth.



It turns out larry isn't so good with physics. He drifts some 15000 feet into the air. He floated over the airport and disrupted air traffic. Imagine what a side that would have been a man with a shot gun in a lawn chair over 3 miles in the air. Eventually larry safely landed but not before getting tangled in some power lines and causing a power outage to the entire Long Beach area. Needless to say the police arrested him on sight. Apparently the FAA considered his act an umbrige of air space.
