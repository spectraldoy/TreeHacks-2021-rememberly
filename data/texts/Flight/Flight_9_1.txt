Larry Walters wanted to fly, The problem was, his vision was poor, thus he was ill-suited to become a pilot. Most people with a similar set of limitations would let go of such a dream. 



Larry Walters was not most people. In June 1982, he tied several dozen helium-filled balloons to his lawn-chair, which was tied to his jeep. Shotgun in hand, the plan was to release the chair from his jeep, go about 30-feet in the air, and have himself a nice afternoon picnic, getting back down through shooting a couple of the balloons with his gun. 



However, Larry Walters was not particularly good at physics either. When he released his chair, he rose about 12,000 feet in the air. Afraid of tipping the chair if he shot a balloon, Larry decided to simply wait it out, and therefore begin to float. This did not cause any commotion until he began to approach the nearby airport's entrance and exit zone. Imagine the surprise of those at the airport to see a man floating in a lawnchair with a shotgun almost a mile in the air!
