Larry Walters had a dream that he could fly. The problem was that his vision was poor and he was thus ill- suited to become a pilot. Most people, faced with such limitations, might just let that dream go.



Larry Walters was not most people. One sunny day in 1982 in his modest San Pedro home, Larry constructed an aircraft compromised of a lawn chair, a seatbelt and forty- odd weather balloons. Armed only with a pellet gun, a CB radio and a cooler full of sandwiches, he cut the line that tethered his craft to his Jeep. The craft rose to about thirty feet, and Larry had himself a nice little picnic. He planned to shoot a couple of the balloons and float back down the earthy, just as easy as can be.



The problem was that Larry was not so good with physics, and his aircraft quickly rose to 15,000 feet. Scared to shoot any of the balloons for fear that he might tip, Larry eventually floated into the Long Beach Airport area. Imagine for a second what that must have looked like. He did eventually drift back down to earth, but not before getting tangled in some power lines and taking out the power for the entire Long Beach area.



Needless to say, upon touching back down, Larry was immediately arrested. It seemed that FAA had not taken kindly to his flying in unregulated airspace. But the story had taken off, an there were a few crack reporters on the scene was he was arrested. One asked why he did it. Larry's response? "A man can't just sit around"
