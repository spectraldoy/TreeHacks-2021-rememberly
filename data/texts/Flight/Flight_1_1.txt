Larry Walters had a dream he could fly. The problem was he had poor vision. He wanted to become a pilot. Normally people with this condition give up on their dream. Not larry walters. 

One day Larry in his modest backyard decides to fly. He attaches 40 balloons to a lawn chair complete with a CB radio and a picnic basket full of sandwiches. His plan is to go a few feet above ground and then shoot out the balloons to gently float back down to the ground. It turns out Larry is not so good with physics. He drifts thousands of feet above the ground. He disrupts air traffic. Image being on a plane and seeing a man in a lawn chair 3 miles above the ground with a shot gun. Many wonder why he didn't just shoot out some balloons and land. It must have been a scary sight. He eventually drifts down but not after being caught in a power line and causing a power outage to the surrounding Long Bay Area. Needless to say he was arrested as soon as he landed. Reporters however had caught whiff of Larry and where following him around. When the police asked him why he did it he replied a man cant just sit around.
