Larry Walters had always wanted to fly. The problem was that he had poor vision, making him ill-suited to be a pilot. Most people would just give up on their dream at this point.



Larry is not most people. He built his own craft made of a lawn chair, a seatbelt, and 40 odd-weather balloons. He brought with him a pellet gun, radio, and some sandwiches. He broke the line tethering him to his Jeep, and planned to float 30 feet above the air, shoot some balloons, and gently float his way back to earth. However, when he broke the line, he found himself 15,000 feet in the air. He didn't dare shoot any balloons for fear the chair would tip.



He soon found himself in Long Beach Airport airspace. Imagine what a sight that was for people waiting for their aircrafts to land! A man in a lawn chair! Eventually he did make it back to earth, but not before getting tangled in some power cords and knocking out power for the entire Long Beach area. 



It goes without saying that when he landed, he was arrested. The FAA took issue with him being in restricted airspace. When he got arrested, there were a lot of reporters. One of the reporters asked why he did it. He replied, "A man can't just sit around!"
