There was a man who loved to be adventurous. He wasn't like other people. He'd wanted to fly for as long as he could remember. One day, he decided to build a contraption in his backyard that would allow him to fly. He attached balloons to a lawn chair and brought along a cooler of sandwiches for a picnic in the air. He untied the lawn chair from his car, and sat on the chair and immediately rose into the air. Unfortunately, he had underestimated the ability of his contraption. Instead of rising only a few thousand feet in the air, it flew way higher than imagined. Soon, this man found himself being flown all across town and into restricted airspace. He thought about just how weird he must look to anybody looking up.

He landed eventually, but not before he got himself entangled in the city's power  lines. When the police approached him upon landing, they expressed their displeasure at him flying into restricted airspace. The man became widely talked about in the town! In fact, when one reporter asked it what had possessed him to do what he did, he responded, "Well, a man can't just sit around".
