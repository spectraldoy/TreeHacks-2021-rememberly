Larry Walters had a dream that he could fly. Unfortunately, Larry had very poor vision, thus making him ill-suited to be a pilot. Other people, faced with similar limitations, would probably give up on their dream.



Larry Walters, however, was not like other people. On a warm summer day in San Pedro, he boarded his makeshift aircraft comprised of a lawn chair, a seatbelt, and 40-some weather balloons. He was also equipped with a pellet gun, a CB radio, and a cooler full of sandwiches. He released the tether that held his aircraft down to his jeep, floating 30 feet into the air to enjoy a nice picnic. When he was done, he planned to shoot a couple of the balloons with his pellet gun and float safely back to the ground. 



Unfortunately, Larry Walters was no so good at physics.  Instead of floating only 30 feet into the air, he went up to 15,000 feet and drifted. He floated into the approach for Long Beach airport. Imagine being one of the people on that plane, waiting to land, looking out your window and seeing a man with a pellet gun in a lawn chair
