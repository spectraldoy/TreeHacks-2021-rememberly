________ really wanted to fly.  Unfortunately he had poor vision.  But that didn't stop him.  One day he put together a lawn chair, some weather balloons, packed a lunch and brought a pellet gun with him and planned to have himself a picnic in the sky.  He was going to shoot one balloon at a time in order to descend.  Unfortunately, ______ was not good at physics and ended up ascending 15,000 sq ft.  He drifted over San Barbara valley and into the airport where he was eventually stopped by some powerline, knocking out the power at the same time.  When he finally landed he was immediately arrested, and was asked by a reporter why he did it to which he replied "A man can't just sit around, a man's gotta do something".
