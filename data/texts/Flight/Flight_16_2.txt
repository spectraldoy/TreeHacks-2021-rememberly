Larry Walters had always dreamed of flying, but due to poor vision was ill-suited to become a pilot. Although most others in his condition would aboandon such a dream, Larry was not one of those people and remainded determined to fly.



On a sunny summer day in 1982 in his home in San Pedro, he constructed a makeshift aircraft out of a lawn chair, a seat belt, and 40-odd weather balloons. He packed a pellet gun, CB radio, and cooler full of sandwiches in order to enjoy a nice little picnic in his modest backyard. Upon releasing the tether that connected his aircraft to his Jeep, Larry rose 30-feet in the air initially.



However, given his limited physics knowledge, Larry eventually ascended 15,000 feet and thus disrupted Long Beach air traffic. Although he ultimately touched down safely, Larry first became tangled in some electrical wires and knocked out power in his entire Long Beach neighborhood region. As to be expected, he was arrested for violation of air traffic regulations by the FAA. However, several crack reporters asked him why he did it, to which he responded "a man just can't sit still."
