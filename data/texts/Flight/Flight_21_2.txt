Equipped with a pellet gun, a CB radio, and some sandwiches, Larry untethered the rope that he attached to his Jeep, and quickly rose thirty or fourty feet in the air.  He expected to have lunch and then shoot a few balloons, lowering back down to Earth as easily as he could. 

But Larry was not good at physics.  Instead he rose 15,000 ft in the air and drifted towards the long beach area.  His story spread and some said that he was afraid to shoot any balloons in fear of rising further up.   Eventually he made his way to the Long Beach Airport, where he got caught up in air traffic.
