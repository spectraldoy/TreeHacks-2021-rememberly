Larry Walters had a dream that he could fly. However, Larry had poor vision and was thus ill-suited to be a pilot. Most people would give up that dream.

But Larry was not most people. On a sunny summer day in 1982 in his modest backyard in San Pedro, Larry built a make shift aircraft. He had a lawn chair, a seat belt, and forty-odd weather balloons. He also carried a CB gun and a cooler full of sandwiches. He released the tether to his Jeep and rose 30 or so feet in the air. He planned on having an easy landing, and when he was ready, he would shoot a few weather balloons and float back down safely to the ground.

But Larry was bad at physics. Instead of floating down to the ground, he shot up 30,000 feet. He was afraid that if he cut the tether the lawn chair would tip. Eventually, he interfered with the airspace at Long Beach airport. He held up the air traffic because he had to land before the plane could. Imagine the folks who were held up because of a man sitting in a lawn chair some three miles above the ground. Larry ended up landing safely, but not before getting tangled in some power chords, causing the entire Long Beach area to lose power.

Larry got arrested because the FAA believed he violated the airport's airspace. Some crack reporters got wind of the arrest and watched it happen. While watching, one of the reporters asked why he'd done it. Larry replied, "I couldn't just sit around".
