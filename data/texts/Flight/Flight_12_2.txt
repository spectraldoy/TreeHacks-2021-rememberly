Larry Walters had a dream he could fly. The problem was Larry's vision was poor, so he was ill suited to be a pilot. Most people, faced with similar limitations, might let go of such a dream. 

	Larry Walters was not most people. On a sunny summer day in 1982, in his modest backyard in San Pedro, Larry boarded a makeshift aircraft that consisted of a lawn chair, a seatbelt, and forty-odd balloons. He was armed with a pellet gun, a CB radio, and a cooler of sandwiches. He released the tether from his Jeep and rose to a height of about thirty feet. His plan was to shoot out a couple of balloons and float back to earth.

	But Larry was not good at physics. When he realized the tether, he rose about 15,000 feet in the air. Some say he didn't shoot the balloons because otherwise his chair would tip. Eventually, he drifted into Long Beach airport, causing a disruption in air traffic. Imagine what he looked like to the people waiting to get clearance to land: a man in a lawn chair about 3 miles above ground. He eventually landed, but first got entangled in some power lines that knocked out the power in Long Beach.

	Larry was arrested, of course, FAA seems to not like people violating their airspace. When he was later asked why he did it, Larry responded," A man can't just sit around."
