Larry Walters had always had a dream that he could fly, but was deterred due to poor vision. Although most people with this ambition would let go of that dream, Larry was not one f those people. 



Determined to be a pilot, Larry assembled a makeshift aircraft in his modest Long Beach backyard on a sunny afternoon. The contraption consisted of a lawn chair with a seatbelt and 40-odd weather balloons attached. Larry packed a cooler full of sandwiches and a pellet gun, and released the tether connecting his aircraft to his Jeep. He enjoyed a nice picnic while he aircraft rose about 30 feet above the ground.



However, unskilled at physics, Larry had underestimated the aircraft's power and the chair ultimately rose 15,000 feet above the ground â€“ thereby disrupting Long Beach air traffic. Upon getting tangled in electrical wires, Larry knocked out power for the entire Long Beach region and was subsequently arrested by the FAA. After landing, several crack reporters recorded him stating that "a man just can't sit still" in response their questions about why he constructed this aircraft.
