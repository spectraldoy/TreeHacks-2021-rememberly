Once upon a time, there was a man who wanted to fly. This man couldn't be a pilot, as he did not have good vision. Most people in his predicament would just give up, but they are not him. He was going to fly.

One day, he decided to make his dream a reality.  He attached 40 odd-weather balloons, a cooler, a gun, and a radio to a lawn chair. He cut the string tethering his lawn chair to his car. He figured he would have himself a nice picnic 15 feet in the air and shoot the balloons until he would float back down. However, physics was not his strongest subject. He kept rising until he was 10,000 feet in the air. Before he knew it, he was in restricted air space. Imagine what a sight that was! A man with balloons and a gun outside your plane window. 

Eventually, he did get down, but not without knocking out out power for the entire long beach area. When he got down, he was arrested for being in restricted air space. Some reporters were around when he got arrested. One journalist asked, "Why'd you do it?" His response was, "A man can't just sit around!"
