Larry Walters had a dream that he could fly. However, Larry had poor eyesight, and was thus not suited to be a pilot. Most people would give up their dream of being a pilot because of this, but Larry was not most people.

On a sunny summer day in Long Beach, he was in his modest backyard and decided to build some kind of flying contraption. He attached his lawn chair and some forty odd weather balloons to his jeep so that he could have a picnic in the air. He rose in the air and cut the tether. Larry was bad at physics so instead of remaining a few feet in the air, he soared to 15,000 feet in the air.

Larry did not know what to do. He was afraid to pop the balloons in case his lawn chair would tip over. He eventually soared over Long Beach airport and interfered with the flight patterns. The flights in the air had to wait for Larry to land before they could land. Imagine what it looked like to the folks watching this from their lawns. Eventually, Larry landed safely, but first got tangled up in some power chords so that the entire city of Long Beach lost power. The other planes were then safe to land. 

Larry was obviously arrested for interfering with flight patterns at the airport. Some reporters caught wind of the story and were very intrigued. After watching Larry get arrested, they asked why he did this and Larry replied, "A man can't just sit around".
