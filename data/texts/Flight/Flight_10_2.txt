Larry Walters had a dream that he could fly.  Unfortunately Larry had poor eyesight which would ill suit a pilot.  The didn't stop Larry Walters from achieveing his dreams.  One fine sunny day in his neighborhood of San Pedro Larry put together a makeshift aircraft out of a lawn chair, seat belt, and 40 weather balloons.  He packed a cooler full of sandwiches, a CV radio, and  pellet gun.  Larry was going to have himself a picnic and then shoot a few balloons in order to descend.  Unfortunately Larry was not good at physics and the makeshift aircraft rose 15,000 feet in the air.  He eventually flew into the Long Beach airport airspace.  Now imagine for a moment what that must have looked like to people in an aircraft waiting to land to see a man in a flying lawnchair with a gun.  Larry eventually landed, but not before getting tangled in some power lines and knocking out all the power of Long Beach.  Needless to say Larry was arrested.  It seems the FAA took umbrage to Larry flying into restricted airspace.  A few crackpot reporters found out about it and one of them asked Larry why he had done it to which Larry replied "A man has to do something."
