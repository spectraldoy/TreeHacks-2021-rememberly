There once was a man who dreamed to fly, but his vision was too poor to earn a license. Although most people would've given up against such obstacles, the man persisted at achieving his dream by taking matters into his own hands.

	One Saturday afternoon in his backyard in San Pedro, the man boarded his makeshift aircraft made out of a lawn chair, 40-odd air balloons, and a seat belt. He brought a BB pellet gun, CB radio, and cooler full of sandwiches with him. He cut the rope that tethered his aircraft to his Jeep and soared about 30 feet into the air. His plan was to shoot down a few balloons to descend back to Earth with his gun, but he wasn't very knowledgeable in physics and ended up ascending to 1500 feet in the air. 

	He floated all the way to the Long Beach air corridor where he disrupted air traffic. People on the ground watched him eventually descend onto some telephone wires where he was rescued and arrested. When reporters asked him why he'd done it, he answered, "A man can't just sit around."
