Larry Walters had a dream that he could fly. The problem was, his vision was bad, and he was thus ill-suited to become a pilot. Most people, faced with similar  limitations, would let go of such a dream. 



Larry Walters was not most people. On a sunny summer day in 1982, Larry boarded his makeshift aircraft, composed of a lawnchair, a seatbelt, and some 40-odd weather balloons. He took with him a weather radio, a pellet gun, and a cooler full of sandwiches. Upon releasing the chair from its tether to his jeep, Larry rose 30 feet in the air, and had a midday picnic. The plan was to shoot out a couple of the balloons and float gently back to earth. 



However, it seemed Larry Walters was not particularly good at physics. He instead rose 15,000 feet in the air.
