Larry Walters had a dream that he could fly. But, Larry had poor vision which made him ill-suited to become a pilot. Many people, faced with similar limitations, may given up their dream. But Larry was not most people.

	One sunny day in the summer of 1982, Larry decided to make a makeshift plane. He boarded the object made of a lawn chair, seat belt, and 40-odd weather balloons. Armed with a CB pellet gun, a basket full of sandwiches, and a radio Larry undid the tether that held him to his Jeep. He rose about 30 feet or so and had himself a nice little picnic. Larry planned on shooting a couple of the balloons and landing as safe as could be.

	As it turns out, Larry was not good at physics. When he released the tether, he rose 15,000 feet in the air. According to reports, he did not dare shoot down any more balloons for fear that the chair would tip. He started to drift toward the Long Beach area and eventually hit the approach section of the Long Beach airport, disrupting air traffic. What a strange sight to see a man on a lawn chair with a gun three miles in the air. Eventually Larry landed down safe in Long Beach, but was not landed long when the police arrested him. Apparently the FAA had an umbrage with him interfering in air space. A multitude of reporters saw the arrest and one of them asked, "why did you do it?" Larry said, "a man can't just sit still".
