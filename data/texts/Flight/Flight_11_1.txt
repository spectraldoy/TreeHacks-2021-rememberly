Larry Walters had a dream he could fly. The problem was that Larry had poor vision so he was ill-equipped for becoming a pilot. This may have stopped most people, but Larry was not most people. One day he hooked up his lawn chair to his Jeep and tethered 40 balloons to it. Armed with a pellet gun, CB radio and a bag full of sandwiches, Larry planned on releasing the chair, floating about 30ft. above the ground where he would have himself a picnic and then gradually shoot out each balloon until he touched down safely. However, Larry was not so good at physics. After his chair released from the Jeep he shot up over 3 miles into the air. He didn't dare shoot out the balloons for fear the chair would tip over. He floated all the way onto Long Beach where he caused some problems with the airport and the runway had to be cleared for him to land. He eventually did land and got stuck in some power lines shutting down power to the entire Long Beach area. Could you imagine how it must have looked to see a man holding a gun
