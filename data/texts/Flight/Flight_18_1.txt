Larry Walters had a dream that he could fly. However, Larry had poor vision, thus he could not become a pilot. Most people would give up after that, but Larry was not most people. 

On a summer day in 1982, Larry was in his backyard creating a makeshift flight vehicle. With a lawn chair, four-odd balloons, a gun, and a cooler full of sandwiches, Larry was going to tether himself to a jeep so he could get about 30 feet off the ground. However, Larry was bad at physics. When he released the tether, he actually floated up to about 15,000 feet in the air. He  didn't want to shoot the balloons in case the lawn chair tipped over. So instead, he floated along. He continued floating into the Long Beach airport airspace. He disrupted air traffic. He eventually came down, after getting tangled in some electrical wires. 

	Larry was arrested for disrupting air traffic. A couple reporters were there and asked why he did such a thing. And he replied "A man can't just sit around."
