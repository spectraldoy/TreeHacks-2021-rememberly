Larry Walters had a dream he could fly. The problem was his poor vision made him ill-suited to be a pilot. That would deter most people, but not Larry Walters.



In his backyard in San Pedro, Larry Walters boarded a makeshift aircraft comprised of a lawn chair, forty-odd weather balloons, and a cooler full of sandwiches.  He also had a CB radio and a pellet gun. He rose thirty feet in the air, tethered by his old Jeep. After having lunch in the air, he untethered himself. He wasn't very good with physics, as he rose 30,000 feet in the air, eventually flying into air traffic. Imagine for a moment the sight of a man floating 3 miles in the air on a lawn chair with a gun. He didn't shoot a balloon fearing the chair would tip.



He eventually touched down, not before running into power lines that took out the entire power of Long Beach. The FAA took umbrage with their air space being violated, so he was arrested.  The public took notice, and a few reporters witnessed his arrest. One quoted Larry Walters as saying why he did it that, "A man can't just sit around."
