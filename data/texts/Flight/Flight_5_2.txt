Larry Walters had a dream he could fly. The problem was that Larry's vision was poor, thus making him ill-suited to be a pilot. Most people, when faced with similar limitations, might have given up this dream. Larry Walters was not most people. On a sunny summer day in 1982, in his modest backyard in San Pedro, Larry boarded a makeshift aircraft comprising a lawn chair, a seatbelt, and forty-odd weather balloons. Armed with a pellet gun, a CB radio, and a cooler full of sandwiches, Larry cut the tie that tethered him to his Jeep, rose thirty feet in the air, and had himself a little picnic. He planned to shoot out a couple of the weather balloons and float gently back to earth, simple as could be. But Larry, it would seem, was not so good with physics. When he cut the tether, he rose 15,000 feet into the air. Some reports say that Larry didn't dare shoot any of the balloons for fear that the chair would tip. Eventually he floated into the Long Beach alnding corridor, disrupting traffic. Imagien for a second how that must have looked the the aircrafts standing byâ€”a man with a gun, floating 3 miles above the earth. Larry did eventually land, but not before getting tangled in some powerlines and knocking out power for the entirety of Long Beach. Larry was promptly arrested upon landing. Seems the FAA didn't take kindly to his violation of restricted airspace. The story had gotten out a little while before his arrest, and some crack reporters were there to witness it. One asked why he did it. His respine? "A man can't just sit around."
