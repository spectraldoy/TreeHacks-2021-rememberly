Larry Walters had a dream that he could fly. Problem was that his vision was poor, making him ill-suited to become a pilot. Most people, faced with similar limitations, may choose to let go out that dream.

	Larry was not like most people. One sunny summer day in 1982 in his modest San Pedro Larry boarded a makeshift aircraft made of a lawn chair, a seat belt, and  40-odd weather balloons. When he released the tether holding the makeshift craft to his Jeep, he rose about 30 feet in the air. Armed with a pellet gun, CB radio, and a cooler full of sandwiches he had himself a nice little lunch. 

	Turns out, Larry is not a great physicist. When he untied the tether, he rose about 15,000 feet in the air. He did not shoot down anymore balloons for the fear of the chair tipping. Eventually he came to the approach section of the Long Beach airport. What it must have looked like to see a man sitting in a lawn chair with a gun, three miles above the ground. 

	Larry eventually touched down safely. However, the FAA seemed to have umbrage about Larry disrupting airspace. They arrested him, but not before word could spread about the incident. One reporter asked him, "why did you do it?" He said, "a man can't just sit still".
