Larry walters had a dream that he could fly. Though he had poor vision which meant he couldn't be a pilot. One day in 1982 while in his modest backyard in San Pedro he decided to build an aircraft out of a lawn chair, a seat belt, and forty odd weather balloons. He packed a cooler with sandwiches and brought his gun. He tethered himself to his jeep and proceeded to float high into the air. He had a little picnic while floating in the air. Apparently larry walters' physics weren't very good because he was 15,000 feet up in the air and had drifted over the long beach airport. He ended up disrupting air traffic and once he came down was arrested. Reporters heard and then asked why he did it he said, " a man can't just sit around."
