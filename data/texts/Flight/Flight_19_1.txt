Larry Walters had a dream that he could fly. Unfortunately, Larry had very poor vision, which made him ill-suited to pursue this dream. Most people in Larry's position would just give up, but Larry wasn't most people. 



Larry pursued his dream of flight in his own makeshift vehicle. In his own backyard, he used a lawn chair, a seatbelt, and 40-some odd weather balloons to try to pursue his dream of flying. One day, he decided to take off and have himself a picnic in the air. The plan was that he would release the tether from his Jeep and float a few hundred feet above the ground and enjoy himself a nice picnic. When he was ready to come down, he would shoot a couple of weather balloons and float safely back to the ground. 



Unfortunately, Larry wasn't that good at physics. Instead of floating a few hundred feet above, he went 15,000 feet into the air.  He floated right into the approach for the Long Beach airport. Imagine if you were a passenger on this plan, and you saw Larry floating in his balloon lawn chair with a gun in his hand. What a sight! Larry couldn't shoot the balloons because he was afraid the chair would tip.  



The FAA was not too happy with Larry and had him arrested. When they asked him why he did it, he said "A man can't just sit around!"
