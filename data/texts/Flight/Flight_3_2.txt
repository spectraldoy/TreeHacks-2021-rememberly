Larry Walters had a dream that he could fly. The problem was that Larry's vision was poor, and he was thus ill- suited to become a pilot. Most people, faced with such limitations, might just let that dream go.



Larry Walters was not most people. One sunny summer day in 1982, in the modest backyard of his San Pedro home, Larry boarded an aircraft comprised of a lawn chair, a seatbelt, and forty- odd weather balloons. He released the line that tethered his craft to his Jeep, armed with a pellet gun, a CB radio, and a cooler full of sandwiches and had a little picnic. He planned to shoot out a few balloons, and float back to the earth just as easy as can be.



It seems Larry was not so good with physics. His aircraft quickly rose to 15,000 feet. Some reports, said he was too scared to shoot any of the balloons for fear that he might tip. He eventually floated into the approach area of the Long Beach airport. Imagine for a second what that must have looked like for the folks who were awaiting clearance to land. A man armed with a gun floating some three miles in the air. He eventually did drift back down, but not before getting entangled in some power lines and taking out the power for the greater Long Beach area. 



Needless to say, upon touching down on earth, Larry was immediately arrested. It seems the FAA had taken umbrage with his flying into restricted airspace. But by that time the story had spread, and a few crack reporters were already on the ground when he was arrested. One asked why he'd done it. Larry's response? "A man can't just sit around."
