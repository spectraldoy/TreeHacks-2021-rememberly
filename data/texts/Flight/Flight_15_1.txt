Larry Walters always had a dream he could fly. Sadly, his vision was too poor. This would deter most people, but not Larry Walters of San Pedro.



He built a makeshift aircraft with a lawn chair, a pellet gun, and about forty weather balloons. With a leather belt and a CB radio, he figured he'd shoot out a couple balloons upon reaching 30 feet. Larry wasn't good with physics, and he found himself 15,000 feet in the air. He was in the restricted flight zone. He didn't shoot out one balloon out of fear the chair would tip.



He eventually touched down safely, not before tangling up in power lines that knocked out all the power in the Long Beach area. He was arrested, as the police didn't take kindly to him in restricted airspace.



Before he was arrested, the public had caught wind and reporters witnessed his arrest. He said to one, "A man can't just sit around."
