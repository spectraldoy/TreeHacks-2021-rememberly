There was once a man who wanted to be a pilot but had really bad eyesight. He decided to take matters into his own hands and make a makeshift aircraft. He used a radio, lawn chair, 40 weather balloons, and a basket to make his craft. He was going to float about 10 feet into the air and then use his shot gun to slowly take down balloons and drift safely back to earth. Instead he wasn't good at physics and drifted much higher into the air and caused air traffic. Imagine seeing a man sitting on a lawn chair with a shotgun while you're inside an airplane! Eventually he did drift down and got caught in a cable wire. He was afraid to shoot out the balloons because he thought the lawn chair would tip. Needless to say he was arrested on the spot. When reporters asked him why he did it he said a man cant just sit around.
