    "We can imagine an educator has assigned students to read a certain text - maybe from the web, maybe a textbook chapter, maybe an academic paper. The educator is trying to decide which concepts from the paper is important for review; they don't have the resources to review it all. One factor of course is importance: they'll want to prioritize important ideas! But maybe they can't even cover every important idea. Another big factor is how much help students might need to really grasp and memorize the concepts. That's where a computational model of human memory for text might come in.\n",
