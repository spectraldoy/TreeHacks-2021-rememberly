        <P style="text-align:center"> In the world of science fiction, AI systems execute esoteric simulations to anticipate and react to your every thought and move - the stuff of nightmares. With our project, we imagine how such a system might work in the context of education - anticipating where learners might need extra attention, and addressing that need efficiently. We prototype an end-to-end platform that integrates a computational cognitive model of reading comprehension with cutting-edge machine learning for natural language processing to:<br>
        <ol>
                <li>Preprocess any arbitrary text for simulation in our cognitive model</li>
                <li>Predict the representations of the text that readers might build as they read it, identifying potential knowledge gaps</li>
                <li>Annotate the text with supplementary explanations and resources to address anticipated gaps and optimize for educational outcomes</li>
                <li>Explain the basis of our recommendations with beautiful, interactive landscape visualizations of model state evolution across the course of simulation</li>
                <li>Validate and update model parameters using data collected across diverse experimental contexts</li>
        </ol>
